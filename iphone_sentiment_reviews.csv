Not FULLY Unlocked,negative
"Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2020Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
  Purchased this product advertised as fully unlocked. Inserted my sim card and it did not work. Contacted my service provider and they checked my IMEI number and it reported that the phone was still locked by the original carrier. Phone came in good condition just couldn't use any service provider.,negative

"NOT EXPECTED, GREAT PURCHASE!",negative

,
  I was feeling a bit skeptical after I placed my order but I was proven wrong! The phone looks brand new besides some very minimal/ light scratches (almost impossible to notice) and the battery life is still at 100%. I also like that there was a screen protector on the phone,positive

"  I fought it for the longest time but I finally gave in and upgraded to the iPhone 11 from the iPhone 7. I looked other places online, but the price was way out of my price point.

The iPhone review,neutral
"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2020Size: 64GBColor: RedService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  My iPhone came with a big scuff on the corner (aluminum frame)  and a small (not really noticible) scratch on the front and back of the phone. I got the 64 gb product red unlocked iPhone 11 which was, I believe a Verizon unlocked phone. My phone came in the iPhone 11 apple box with a original apple charger and original apple brick.  When I set up my phone I just put in my T-Mobile sim and the phone started working with my data. I did not need to get it activated or anything.",positive

The phone came in itâ€™s original box with original charger and cable and the phone looks excellent, not one scratch on it absolutely beautiful and the battery health was at 100%. I definitely recommend the seller GoOverstock, as I will definitely be buying from them again.",positive

,
"  My iPhone came with a big scuff on the corner (aluminum frame)  and a small (not really noticible) scratch on the front and back of the phone. I got the 64 gb product red unlocked iPhone 11 which was, I believe a Verizon unlocked phone. My phone came in the iPhone 11 apple box with a original apple charger and original apple brick.  When I set up my phone I just put in my T-Mobile sim and the phone started working with my data. I did not need to get it activated or anything.",neutral

"  I received my phone a day early and it came exactly as I imagined. I was a little nervous buying a refurbished phone on the internet, but I truly have no complaints. The phone came in perfect, like new condition and has been working great with my carrier and in general.Came with a charger and charging block as mentioned in the description. It also came with a screen protector that was already put on the screen! That was an awesome and much appreciated touch. Thereâ€™s also 60 day warranty and free returns just in case something were to happen.Iâ€™m incredibly pleased. Would definitely recommend to anyone!",positive

Donâ€™t trust Tech Exchange!,negative
"Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2020Size: 64GBColor: RedService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
  Donâ€™t trust the refurbished phone from Tech Exchange!! The ear speaker on this phone does not work. I can turn the phone on speaker phone and make a phone call but when you try and take it off speakerphone all you hear is garbled voices and a lot of static. You can understand about every 10th word.  Then today when trying to make a phone call with the speakerphone every time I pushed one of the numbers to dial in the number from the pack and made a really loud high-pitched tone. When  I hit the side button to try and shut the sound off the screen went black and it still was making this weird high-pitched sound that ended up stopping after about 30-45 seconds very annoying. I finally had to shut the phone completely off and turn it back on at which point I was able to make a call on speakerphone. Iâ€™ve never had problems like this with a refurbished phone! After doing a chat with Amazon they told me I had to handle it with the seller who is supposed to be calling me to provide me with a prepaid label to return it and to discuss a replacement phone. The return policy says I have to return the phone to them and then they have two weeks to give me a refund on my money so that it will be another two weeks before a order a different phone.I just want to say that after I finally received a call from them my refund was processed very promptly.,negative

This iPhone 11 was working for a few days but all of the sudden ""stopped"" recognizing my SIM card.

everything OK but the price is still too high compared to a new one with all original accessoires,negative
"Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2020Size: 64GBColor: PurpleService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  IPhone was shipped in two-day delivery. The box inside of a FedEx bag came opened but the FedEx bag itself was untouched, so I presume it was not completely closed before sealing the bag. The phone came with no scratch or sign of usage at all, a screen protector (nice touch) and generic certified usb cable and charger. No earphones as described. Battery life is 100%. So far it looks and works good. Im only a little concerned that it gets quite hot in the back.Im only doing the math and believe $639.99 is still a high price for a refurbished. If you want replace the generic stuff by purchasing an original charger + cable + earpods + connector, the total price will go beyond a brand new phone.",positive

"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2020Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  ""Fully unlocked and compatible with any carrier of choice"" is is a false statement in their add for Amazon. When I received the phone there was a paper inside the box saying not compatible with Sprint or Boost Mobile. I happen to use one of those carriers, and rather then erasing all my info that I already had transferred from my old phone to the new phone and mailing the phone back I chose to switch carriers which was an additional pain. So BuySPRY won in the end but I will never purchase from them again.",negative

Im happy i got a discount and that i didnt buy a new one and just have this one sit around and get scrapped for parts or something. I honestly dropped $690 bucks on this thing and i was gonna go ballistic if it didnt show up,  but it came early and im so relieved and happy with it,  its absolutely beautiful.

"  I shopped around a lot for a renewed, refurbished iPhone 11. This was not the cheapest but really close. The selling point for me is that it comes with a 90 day warranty and refund policy and is sold through Amazon Prime. We received the phone 4 days ago. Upgraded and transferred everything from the iPhone 7 to the 11 flawlessly. Plus, the phone had no cosmetic issues at all. It looks brand new. We have bought a refurbished iPhone 7 and now this 11. Both worked perfectly.",positive

"  As far as buying this product from this specific seller, my experience has been great! Nothing to complain about. There were no scratches in the glass display, not to mention there werenâ€™t any on the back glass or camera lenses either. But as far as the phone itself, Iâ€™m an android person but my first smartphone happened to be an iPhone and I had gone through a couple generations of them. Iâ€™m pleased to say that this device feels great but, itâ€™s still an iPhone and to that, I mustnâ€™t give a full 5 star review. Android gang.",positive

"  This phone is great! (Please excuse the somewhat blurry pics, I have shaky hands) The battery health was already at 100% and its has barely any cosmetic damage. Save for a super tiny little nick at the top which is barely noticeable unless I shine a camera directly at the area. Also, the phone came preinstalled with a screen protector! I guess its a bit of a minus that it doesnt come with headphones, but I already have airpods, so that doesnâ€™t bother me.

"  After only 3.5 months the phone is completely dead and will not charge.  Took to Apple store and was told it would have to be replaced.  WTH!  Ordered and received early October 2020.  Started having charging issues last week and now it is completely dead.  And wouldn't you know it is past the return date by a mere 12 days.  Come on Amazon, you sold me this product you need to stand behind it or at least replace or refund something that lasts only days longer than the return window.  BS!",negative

"  Well I got the iPhone 11 yesterday and it currently right now will shut off every 5-10 mins , I have tried multiple times to contact the carrier and they havenâ€™t emailed me back or nothing which I spent 700$ on a phone Iâ€™d like to get atleast a phone I can have a conversation on .. I donâ€™t even want my money back I just want my phone fixed because itâ€™s honestly a great phone but I think you should get a better technician that works on your phones cause I even called Apple to see what they recommend I do (thatâ€™s what they said ab the technician ) but Iâ€™m just disappointed I was so excited now I just feel ripped off ):",negative

  So pleased. The phone came with a screen protector on it already even! And weâ€™ll placed! No scuffs. Phone is seriously like brand new. Battery is 99%. I was skeptical after a bunch of 1 star reviews but figured I would try it because there is a 90 day guarantee and return. Donâ€™t feel scared about this deal. Try it out. You will be pleased.I got the black 256gb unlocked iPhone 11 just FYI.,positive

  For the most part everything is okayDifferent parts of the screen wonâ€™t work during certain timesSo I have to lock and unlock my phone constantly Nd hope it will work afterWhile writing this review I canâ€™t even hit the bottom right corner to add punctuation unless it comes up from autocorrectWhen I contacted the company they told me to hard reset it and it should work afterThat worked for less than a day and I donâ€™t want to have to hard reset my phone every other day for it to work when I spent seven hundred dollarsCanâ€™t even use numerical charactersUpdate I reached out to them again saying their advice didnâ€™t work and havenâ€™t received a response and itâ€™s been a week,neutral

  I am absolutely happy with my purchase! Iâ€™ve gone through the reviews and was ready to order right after. The only thing is my battery health was at 84% as I seen others with 100% which is fine by me. Itâ€™s nothing to go get a new battery when and if that time comes. As you see in the pictures the phone is in great condition annnndddd itâ€™s unlocked so you can use any phone service for it. Iâ€™m digging the picture quality especially after upgrading from the iPhone X to this. What a difference a upgraded phone makes! It came with a cute case plus a charger. If youâ€™re looking into this phone Iâ€™d say go for it. Iâ€™m on day 1 and Iâ€™m excited!!! (UPDATE! April 18th) Iâ€™m 1 month in with the phone and itâ€™s still working great no issues at all.,positive

  I canâ€™t send messages to anyone who doesnâ€™t have an iPhone. The power button doesnâ€™t work correctly and often times Siri doesnâ€™t respond. The only way to get the issue corrected is to be without a phone until the seller sends me a new one. Iâ€™d never buy again or from this company.,negative

"  Certified. Refurbished. Quality Controlled. 70-point inspection.All indicators that you better insure any and every product purchased under the brand BuySpry because as the name suggests it will break quickly. Hopefully you are one of the lucky ones that buy second hand and receives a product that functions and lasts. You have no assurance or guarantee, just a wish. Be very careful within initial return period (most often 30 days) as any even small issue needs to be addressed. That issue, whatever it may be will prove fatal in due time. It is almost as if devices are programmed to break after 30 days. In my personal case, the iPhone I purchased after a week of normal use suffered critical issue. Customer service did not respond to the most recent message from me via email. After speaking to them on phone they stated resolution would be a refund. Do you have a back up device? I hope so. In the lucky case of an exchange (which I pushed for) brace yourself for longer than promised times to receive new product. There is a chance this turns into groundhog day but I hope you receive a working product that endures.Overall enterprise and business solution, would be to place more in reserves for replacement and increase service ability to send new product with promissory of receiving broken product. Filling this void, keeping customers whole while resolving issue. Leaving customers a loaner device would increase their reputation, making them the tallest in a room of short people but hey, you would purchase with confidence under that premise right? Do not buy from this organization if you plan to gift. Please do your loved one a favor and keep BUYSRY's mediocre business and risk to yourself. Just buy her something new you cheapskate! Good luck and stay healthy.",negative

"  I have never bought a used phone before and I've never bought one online. I always went through my carrier. However, this time I was ready to save some money and get an unlocked phone. I was a little nervous but I did some research and then took a risk since I had time to return it for a full refund if it didn't work out. The phone came in perfect condition and works like new. To me, I can't tell the difference between this phone and a brand new one! I've been using it for about 4 days and I've had no issues! Definitely worth the risk.",positive

"  I got this when the battery life in my last phone, the LG V30 started tanking. I figured that I could easily try the current iPhone and sell it again if I didn't like it. I am pleasantly surprised by pretty much everything this phone offers.I'm going to start with the battery life, because that is the because surprise I have had coming to this phone. On day one with my old phone, I would get at max 6 hours of SoT (screen on time) before the phone would die. That was typically enough for me to go from 6am to 10pm with enough left over for me to not feel worried about dying in the middle of the day. Prior to buying this phone that battery life dropped to roughly 3.5-4 hours of SoT before dying.This new (refurbished I know) phone easily gets ~8 hours of SoT, easily going even higher depending on what I'm doing. I can go a full two days without a charge. That's with bluetooth on 24/7. To say I am happy with the battery is an understatement.The other features, are also pretty good. Not anything that blows me out of the water, but definitely at least as good as the other competition. The face unlock, which I assumed was going to be terrible, is much better than I expected. I would still prefer a fast fingerprint sensor, but this thing does the job almost as well. I have had a few instances where it refuses to recognize me on the first attempt, but they are uncommon. The camera is as good as you would expect from a modern smartphone, with several extra features that are actually useful in certain circumstances.Long story short: I will definitely be sticking with this phone for the foreseeable future.",positive

"  Itâ€™s a refurbished phone I donâ€™t mind that it didnâ€™t come in an original box, the phone itself is in very very good shape, I was so skeptical about buying this phone from amazon since itâ€™s my first time buying a phone online but it is in very good condition! No cracks no scratches ! Looks brand new !! Seems to be working fine for now hopefully it stays that way I just need to see if itâ€™ll work with my carrier, it came with a screen protector which was a nice touch :) really happy with the productUPDATE!!!! After a Month or two of having it, it still works really great! Batter life is long and it charges super fast. Highly recommend",positive

"  Apple iPhone 11, 64GB, Red - Fully Unlocked (Renewed) arrived in only two days nicely packaged and looks brand new! Only one, barely noticeable scratch on the screen and a very tiny scratch on the side that you can notice if you hold it really close to your face. Overall I'm very satisfied. I've had the phone for 24 hours now, works really well and fast and battery is still going since I charged it yesterday, it's at currently at 29%. If any unusual changes occur in the near future I'll update my review but I doubt it since the phone is in near perfect condition",positive

"  A BIG thank you for selling iPhones on Amazon! I wanted this phone so bad and couldnâ€™t get my hands on it anywhere unlocked. I am so glad I could buy in through Amazon, This is how we get everything so we knew it was reliable. The phone did not come in an apple iPhone box, but a box just the same with a charger no headphones. But I could care less because all I wanted was the phone. Works great, you wouldnâ€™t even know the difference. I have since told friends and family to do the same when looking for a new phone. Plus it was much cheaper then I found it anywhere else. Very pleased that I got exactly what I wanted for an amazing deal!",positive

  I received a phone that had a crack in the screen which wasnâ€™t that big of a deal but the something was off with camera though compared it my boyfriends phone who ordered the same one from Apple and I think it was replaced with a different one and the biggest problem with the phone was that itâ€™s kept restarting I thought maybe I was doing it by accident but no it would turn off while I didnâ€™t have it my hand but using my AirPods . I also had problems trying the return the phone as the shipping label they sent roundly be taken by fedex and I had to pay myself all around youâ€™d be better off buying new phone from Apple it ended up being cheaper .all around I paid $780 for the phone unlocked from Apple donâ€™t waste your money,negative

,
"  This review is based on the renewed status of the phone and not of the iPhone itself. I had previously purchased a renewed Galaxy phone from Amazon and the phone was practically new for a small fraction of the price and it came with the original box and accessories. I thought it'd be worth it to save $100 or more since my last experience went so well. Unfortunately, the iPhone I received was very visibly used with scratches littering both sides of the phone, but without deep cracks to the screen. The battery's health was on the lower side. The phone also came in a generic box with generic accessories, which was to be expected since it is in the item description, but when you look at what you get for the renewed price it seems like a poor deal. Thankfully Amazon has a longer return period if the phone doesn't work out for you, but I only needed a few minutes with the phone to know that I'd rather buy a new phone from Apple for $100 more.",negative

Phone couldâ€™ve been better the price is a little too high .,
"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2021Size: 64GBColor: PurpleService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  The phone came in with scratches on it but after I put the screen protector on you canâ€™t see it and whenever you put the screen protector on itâ€™s gone have some like bubbles I put it on over and over and the bubbles seems to not go away but, overall itâ€™s good I guess it doesnâ€™t have YouTube but Iâ€™m satisfied I guess but, the price shouldâ€™ve been lower than this since itâ€™s refurbished and still come in the mail kinda mess up. The face recognition works fine battery was fine the setup was good only took 5 mins.",

DEFECT PHONE. NOT WORTH IT.,
"Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2021Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  So I gave the phone another chance after it kept glitching on me but itâ€™s definitely a no. The phone already came cracked on the side where the lock button is, I guess thatâ€™s why the phone wonâ€™t power off for me to complete the activation. Second after finally getting the phone to activate after letting it die out for a day because you have to turn a phone off & on for proper activation it finally started to work. I had gotten a screen protector & phone case for this iPhone 11 all for it not to work. After four days of having the phone i could no longer have a conversation on the phone. I could answer the phone & people could hear me but I couldnâ€™t hear them, Then shortly after being on the phone it would hang up & say call failed. When I was on FaceTime the front camera was glitching on the video. Iâ€™ve had enough of this phone. Called straight talk this morning to have my minutes transferred to my other phone, will be taking my screen protector & case off && taking my new sims card out to return this phone TODAY for a full refund. This is my second time purchasing a phone from Amazon & BOTH times the phones were defects or glitches how you wanna say. I will NOT be ordering anymore phones online again. First time shame on you, second time shame on me & there will NOT BE A THIRD. People please read these reviews carefully because the person selling you the phone do NOT care. They fix these phones thatâ€™s broke & try to sell them thinking theyâ€™ve found a dummy because most wonâ€™t return the phone but I had a little time today & will have more when I get my refund today. Iâ€™ll give the phone one star because the phone takes nice back pictures but THATS IT.",

"Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2021Size: 128GBColor: RedService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Received phone.  It looked good, then after charging it overnight the screen was a jumble of blurred vertical lines.  Amazon insisted we had to deal with the seller.  Could not clear the phone as the screen didnâ€™t work.  Communication from the seller was scripted, they never really answer your questions.  Sent phone back to seller.  They refunded 1% and kept 99% as a restocking fee!  Then we had to force Amazon to deal with it to get a full refund.  Horrible seller, buyer beware!!!",

"Okay quality, a few complaints.",
"Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2020Size: 64GBColor: YellowService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  It came in perfect condition, no scratches, nothing was wrong. The battery life was at 100 percent. I had no complaints. One thing I noticed was that the app snapchat is glitchy on the phone. If you try to edit something for your story it just discards it after 30 seconds. Other than that,  it didn't come with earphones. As most people know the Iphone 11 has no headphone jack. So it's crucial that when we buy these phones we should get everything like new. Also, the charger is probably only a foot long. I like to play games or change my music while i'm laying down. I can't do that because the charger is so short. Last but not least, when you get the phone, the instructions are horrible. It tells you to download an app and what not, that just glitches your phone. Don't do it. Instead look up a video online on how to insert a sim card into an Iphone. From there, when you turn on the phone it will have instructions set up from apple. Do not! I repeat do not! Use the instructions provided. If you are switching from android to apple, it will take you longer to set up your phone because you need an apple ID. Also, you need to save your contacts, and write them down. Even after saving all my contacts to my sim card, when I inserted it, none were there. So it's crucial to remember your contacts.",

I had high hopes,
"Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2021Size: 64GBColor: PurpleService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  I requested an exchange because the phone I got reset on me a few times while trying to set it up. Like I had to redo adding my wifi and password, all the settings like country, prompts, etc. They made the return process so easy so Iâ€™ll give them props for that! Just got the â€œexchangeâ€ item. ITâ€™S THE SAME EXACT PHONE I SENT BACK! I know because I recognize the small set of scuffs in the top right hand corner. They asked if I wanted the same color and I specified if it was available or Iâ€™d even take a white if it was a better option. They just replaced the little back sticker that came off when I had to clean it the first time I received it because it arrived dirty( like how phones get when theyâ€™ve been on a case for a while and the random dust/gunk that kind of accumulates) and added a fancy gold charging cord instead of the play white one. For paying over $400 for a renewed phone like this one Iâ€™d say OVERPRICED. They should base their prices off of how the phone looks and not just charge the same for all phones. I can say Iâ€™m disappointed to say the very least. The battery life is 86%.  The renewed iPhone 8plus I ordered 2 years ago (from somewhere similar) came at 97% battery life. Thatâ€™s why I had high hopes it would be fine to order renewed.Will not order from again when the time comes to get a different phone. Iâ€™ve learned my lesson.",

As Advertised,
"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2020Size: 256GBColor: WhiteService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Iâ€™m pleasantly surprised with this transaction.  Iâ€™m a true skeptic and regularly conduct extensive research when making this type of purchase.  The phone doesnâ€™t come in original packaging and the cord and wall adapter are definitely not Apple products. The usb connection on the wall adapter had was bent and i could not slide the usb into the adapter....that was tossed into the trash.  With that said, the product I care most about was the phone itself and it is exactly as advertised.  It stared right up and went through start up process.  My entire phone was transferred within an hour and I was on my way.  Iâ€™ve been using it for about 4 days now and the battery life is strong and all the features work perfectly (no sticky buttons, etc).  I would definitely recommend this vendor if you only care about getting the iPhone as itâ€™s supposed to be.  If youâ€™re concerned about packaging and having a â€œuniquelyâ€ Apple experience, you may want to pay the additional $400 at the Apple store.",

Pay attention to the 1-star ratings,
"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2020Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Phone doesnâ€™t work on the providers they say it will. I really wish Iâ€™d paid attention to the 1-star ratings before I bought it.Pros: the phone is in great condition and it works wellCons: Itâ€™s not really unlocked â€“ or its some weird hardware configuration. It wonâ€™t connect to the providers they said it would. I was on a Verizon network and bought the phone so I could switch to sprint. It didnâ€™t work on sprint. I contacted the sellerâ€™s support, and they gave me lots of things to try. I tried them long enough for the return window to pass. Then they basically said, too bad for me.If I had it to do again, Iâ€™d spend a little more and get something that works properly. Or just returned the phone and got another.",

Brand new Purple iPhone 11!,
"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2020Size: 128GBColor: PurpleService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Got my phone in two days rather than five standard shipping days! I was happy it came sooner than expected!  I was nervous about ordering a renewed phone online because I didnâ€™t want to spend $700 on a phone not knowing if it  was damaged or not, but Iâ€™m happy to say it came like brand new with no dents or scratches!! Iâ€™m so happy I made this choice because it saved me almost $300 from ordering on the apple website. Would definitely take the chance if your looking to buy the phone from them. The phone came in a different box with just a charger, FYI.",

Doesn't turn on at all,
"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2020Size: 64GBColor: PurpleService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  If there was a way to leave a 0 star, I would. I got the phone in the mail, super excited to get it up and running, and it wouldn't turn on. I called Apple and was on a call with them for 30 mins and they couldn't help me get the phone on either. Needless to say, I'll be returning the phone without even getting a chance to use it.",

Bad refurb job,
"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2020Size: 256GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
  All they did was replace the glass. The sides of the phone are all scratched up not refurbished at all and the cables included are all aftermarket... not really pleased with the way the phone looks at all. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money for a new one.,

"BEWARE OF SELLER ""BuySPRY""",
"Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2020Size: 128GBColor: YellowService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  The iPhone 11 my son bought from BuySPRY technically works in the sense of being a very expensive digital camera and ipod, but not as a phone.  In august, we were contacted by our phone service provider Xfinity Mobile who said the phone was flagged for being from Asia, possibly counterfeit, and therefore unusable on their system.  Checking with Verizon, ATT, and T-Mobile with IMEI, the answer was the same - nobody wants this phone on their system.  We contact BuySPRY who asked for the IMEI, which I immediately sent, and they have ghosted us since. We are now out of the return window, and my son has wasted his money.",

Just keep going...DO NOT buy a phone from these people!,

"  What an awful, frustrating month long experience. Save yourself a ton of grief and aggravation and do not buy a phone here!! This whole experience was tragic. The phone was an absolute complete and total piece of worthless junk. The key board didn't work, it constantly froze up, it muted itself whenever it felt like it. I initiated a return process after the hassle of importing everything onto it then having to reverse the process when I realized the phone was possessed. I contacted the company and their big solution was to have me take the phone to a local repair shop like it was a pair of shoes and get an estimate for repairs, send them said estimate and they would then reimburse for the repair cost if the estimate was to their liking.NO WAY!! Ludacris, absurd solution! I finally had to get Amazon customer service involved, 6 phone calls over the span of a week and they were nice about it but I had to drive the phone 45 minutes to a UPS drop off spot after that and finally got a refund but not for the full price paid so I had to call Amazon AGIAN to get it fully rectified. Even the Amazon representative said this was a totally bogus response and proposed solution from the seller and to not buy 3rd party seller items in future. Lesson learned! Don't waste your time with this company. they sell you junk and make it as hard as possible to return for a refund. one month out and I still don't have a phone. Waiting till Black Friday at this point and buying new.",

"  I was going to buy my girlfriend a bigger phone than her SE2020â€¦ but was worried about her not liking it not having a home button. Her fingers donâ€™t always have a good tactile feel and has a hard time doing screen motions.She wasnâ€™t to keen on the Face ID either.So after looking at the IPhone XR, XS Max and the 11, I decided to go with the 11. I looked through about 15 vendors and their review scores. This vendor came through pretty well. There is a small nick in the paint right above the power button, case hides it though.The battery is at 100%!! I did have some questions about the ear speaker. The calls were sounding crackly. I called Amazon and got disconnected but they emailed me and said to try and brush the ear speaker out. I did it and it seems to have helped but I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s 100%.The phone is great, It came with a screen protector on it and I donâ€™t like those at all but it is on there very well so Iâ€™ll leave it for now.My girlfriend is getting my IPhone 8+ which has a bigger screen than hers and retains the home button.Overall happy with it, it does take some time getting use to it without a home button but Face ID works well.",

  it seemed like new the thing I didnâ€™t like is was it wasnâ€™t in its original boxing didnâ€™t even last three months and the screen started bugging out since itâ€™s refurbished and the seller wonâ€™t help me by swapping it or giving you a refund. Iâ€™m mad and upset 700$ for a busted iPhone 11 what a rip off:( donâ€™t buy this product as itâ€™s just a broken phone. Better off buying a new one. They wonâ€™t even swap or anything. Like I just want a full refund n to send it back:( very unpleasant,

"  Not gonna lie, after reading some of the reviews, I was a little hesitant to buy a Renewed phone, but in the end I'm super glad I did it! My phone came a day earlier than I expected, was nicely packaged, and already had a screen protector applied (no bubbles!). Set up and transfer from my old 6+ was simple. Got my apple watch transferred over. Cameras all work great, face ID has no issues so far, etc. Obviously it's been less than a day, but so far, so good! â™¥",

Keep in mind it is refurbished.,
"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2020Size: 128GBColor: WhiteService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Keep in mind these items are refurbished, which means someone else has had them - it may have a screen cover or already have knicks and chips. Based on my experience - there's a huge chance it could have been opened and repaired. If the phone was opened and the water resistant seal wasn't sealed correctly - you may lose the water resistant rating that these phones should have. There's a small chance of that happening, but it could still happen. Good thing - you have an extended 90 day return policy when it comes to Amazon refurbished returns.If Amazon offered unlocked, new phones - I would go that route - unfortunately they don't.",

"  Â I couldnâ€™t have made a wiser decision about this iPhone 11. First off, itâ€™s almost $60 cheaper than a brand new one, which is practically a steal. Then, it arrives 3 days early, who doesnâ€™t love that? Lastly, I have boost mobile as a phone provider, so purchasing the phone totally unlocked was the way to go, walking into the store and getting the phone activated with the plan I already have took about 10 minutes, all I needed was a SIM card to be put in, which is $10.To anyone worrying about buying this and it being a bust, fear not! I am over the moon, elated about my purchase. Worth every penny.",

"  Â ** Edit **The seller provided a copy of the report showing all components were OEM, so it was simply an oversight on the Quality Control of the reseller - which is understandable, since it was only noticed upon angled inspection.*****This phone actually looked amazing - barely any scratches on the case and the screen appeared wonderful.... UNTIL it's held at an angle.  See video clip of how rippled / warbled the screen was - obviously a non-OEM quality replacement job.  And likely a poorly completed job by the seller.when applying screen protector(s) it became horribly noticeable - the protector couldn't fully adhere, leaving bubbles that couldn't rub out because the underlying screen wasn't smooth.  Disaster - waste of 2 protectors.Sad part - this was our 2nd refurb phone, the first had the original glass - but was pretty scratched up.  Not worth $500 as a refurb.  Returned, purchased from a different seller.  Lesson learned - just spend $50 more and buy it new from Apple.com",

"  Honesty is greatly appreciated these days. They delivered exactly what they promised: The phone arrived timely and it looked brand new. Everything worked smoothly as I expected. Unfortunately, I wasn't very thrilled about the phone size because I have always liked larger phones, so I contacted the seller for a refund. They kindly instructed me as to how to return the item in order to get a full refund back on my card. So far, so good. No complaints and I would definitely do business with these people again.",

"  I donâ€™t write many reviews, however, there were some reviews about this iPhone that werenâ€™t good. So I wanted to write a review myself.I highly recommend this phone.I will start by saying that I am impressed with the condition of my new phone. After inspecting the physical shape of the device I am very pleased to say that it looks almost perfect! Just looking at it you can't see anything wrong with it. But after looking closely there are a couple of very small scuff marks on the edge of the phone. But that's not a deal-breaker to me because that's covered by a case.The battery was charged more than 80% and the battery life of the phone is 100%. I have never owned a phone with a battery life over 85%. So far the batter has held a charge for 2 days after using it a good bit.Face recognition and other features work great I have no issues.The  biggest perk of this phone has to be the speaker during phone calls. It works amazing! I can hear the person I'm talking to without having on speaker phone. This is a huge perk.",

  Mine came with a dead pixel and 90 percent battery life. I returned it and just bought a new one. While you might get lucky and get a like new product it just isnâ€™t worth it to me to save 50 dollars. They need to lower their price to around 100 less then new to make me ever think about buying a used phone again.,

"  The first phone I received had a problem with the charging port so I sent it back and had no problems with the return at all and another phone was promptly sent with no questions asked. I was a little nervous buying a refurbished phone, but it is now over a month old and working great and I was quite pleased that it came early by Fed-X.The phone came in a nice box that had the iPhone, Apple charger, charging block, and a screen protector already installed on the phone. I transferred the Sim Card from my iPhone 6 into the new phone with no problem. I didn't need to have the phone activated and everything from my old phone transferred readily.I received everything I ordered: iPhone 11, 256 gb, red, and unlocked. The phone looks brand new, has no dents or scratches on the screen. The battery is at 89% but other than that it could be a new phone instead of a refurbished one. The cameras quality is amazing.This is a great phone for the price as I could not afford to buy it new. I am totally pleased with the service that I received and would definitely recommend buying a refurbished phone to anyone needing a new phone but not able to pay the price for a new one!",

"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2020Size: 64GBColor: GreenService Provider: T-MobileProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",

  Ordered this phone because it said it worked for TMOBILE.  It doesn't work with TMobile and it isn't unlocked. It is carrier locked to a different company and cannot be unlocked through TMobile. According to TMOBILE  it can only be unlocked through the original carrier and they don't know who that is. Big waste of time and money! I've asked for a refund but this is just more days of waiting to be able to buy a phone. Writing this review so others can be cautious.,

  I purchased the phone but when I took it to T-Mobil the device wouldnâ€™t allow them to activate it. T-Mobil spoke with the customer care person from the seller but they couldnâ€™t get it to work. So they told me to send it back. Prr rt onlem is now they donâ€™t have anymore â€¦ at least not at that price. When asked what they can go for me they said nothing. After they receive the device they will credit me.I ended up buying a NEW one unopened and unused by T-Mobil for $599. Yeah it was $113 more but it is unused AND THIS TIME IT ACTUALLY WORKS!!!! They should at least guarantee me another one at that price or at the very least do something for my troubles. The customer care person was nice and polite. But reiterated that there was nothing he can do and this happens. Unfortunately I wouldnâ€™t recommend this company. But new or from Amazonâ€™s renew store. They at least stand by there products and guarantee satisfaction.,

Overall pleased with experience,
"Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2021Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  I had to send my first phone back as there was a scratched area on the screen about the size of a quarter. Called Amazon and got replacement ordered right away no problem with Amazon Renewed guarantee.Second iPhone comes and literally the same scratched area on this one too. If I didnâ€™t know better, I would have thought they were the same phone based on the scratched area. I decided to put on a screen protector and see if that minimized the scratches, which it did.I believe the scratches are part of the refurb process or something, but would really have preferred the seller to have done better QC. I didnâ€™t want to send back another time so I kept the phone. Because of that, I give 3 stars. Good price and responsive seller and Amazon was good to work with, but my wifeâ€™s phone from another seller didnâ€™t have the screen scratch issue I did.Battery life seems good and no other issues with the phone. I feel like a scratched screen is kinda a big deal though since the screen is the phone basically. It also wasnâ€™t a scuff as I could ever so slightly catch a finger nail on it and I tried to rub it off.",

"Terrible audio, disappointed",

"  I was very excited and looking forward to receive my new iPhone, but now Iâ€™m feeling I shouldâ€™ve paid the extra $50 to buy a new iPhone from Apple directly. At first glance the phone looks great! Came with a screen protector with no noticeable scratches/damages to the phone physically. When setting up my phone one of the first things I noticed was how loud the sound was, sound quality was off too. I had my audio low and on mute and notification rings were still loud. Then I got my first phone call and thatâ€™s I become disappointed. It was difficult to hear and understand the other person the phone, I had to switch to speaker to listen. It sounds staticky like if it werenâ€™t plugged in correctly or if speakers were in the wrong place. Iâ€™m afraid to go to the Apple store to get the battery replaced (since the battery arrived at 88% health). Iâ€™ve only been playing with phone for 6 hours now and have found questionable thing like the audio issue that have disappointed me in my purchase...",

Screen has scratches,

,
"  Plus the BUY BACK Program is a scam.  They try to low ball you,  AFTER saying the expected amount they'll give you AFTER you've already sent it in.  Then if you don't accept you get it back weeks later.  Plus I sent it in with a brand new ""Real Apple Charge Cable & Charger"" and they KEPT the cable and charger, only returned the phone.  The phone I traded in, was in better screen shape than the screen on the phone I purchased.  Will NEVER do this again.",

Updated -- Defective phone but eventual refund,
"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2022Size: 128GBColor: BlackService Provider: VerizonProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  This phone never really worked well (wouldn't install apps, face recognition worked for maybe a week, got a message saying it wasn't an authentic interface... so I wonder if I got scammed and this wasn't even a real iphone) and it had microfractures - fell off the arm of my couch onto carpeted floor (while in protective case with screen protector!) and the back totally cracked. Sent it back and the restocking fee was $574.19 on the purchase price of $579.99.There was an issue getting the Apple ID disassociated with the phone, but after that, the seller did go ahead and refund the rest of the phone price. I wish communication would have been clearer, since I initially thought the restocking fee was almost the price of the phone (that's how it came through) and I was very frustrated about that. I'm grateful it was eventually refunded since phones (especially iphones) are pricey.",

"It works, cheap screen",
"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2021Size: 128GBColor: GreenService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Upgraded my phone from an XR to the 11 and have spent 24 hours with it at the time of review.Pros: I got more storage space (128GB vs 64GB), and the upgrade in the camera is great. I also love the green color and am glad it came with a screen protector already on it.Knowing this was a used phone, I wasnâ€™t expecting perfection. However, the screen has two small gouge-like scratches, which is annoying because I can tell this screen is a third-party, cheaper replacement, as itâ€™s backlight is more yellow than the XR screen. It could (and should) have been replaced prior to shipment. Battery health is at 84%, but still lasted longer today than the XR battery with a health of 88% (and under heavier use as I played YT music most of the day). That said, those are the only two issues Iâ€™ve been able to find, so thereâ€™s no real complaint. The price was right for an upgraded phone.",

Cheaper through boost.,
"Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2021Size: 64GBColor: PurpleService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
  I ordered this phone for over $500 on here. Itâ€™s supposed to be a renewed fully unlocked phone. Upon receiving the phone I noticed pits and scratches on back of phone which was a no biggie since I have a case for it. But upon installing my SIM card from my existing boost  iPhone into this phone and it wouldnâ€™t work. It just said no service on top corner of phone. I then went to Boost website to try to activate it and then I noticed that they had the same  phone for $449. So decided to send this back and order from boost and I know o wonâ€™t have any issues when I transfer my SIM card from my existing phone.,

FEELS LIKE WE GOT SCAMMED,
"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2021Size: 64GBColor: PurpleService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  I purchased this phone in March to give to my kid sister for her 15th bday. The phone had been working fine for months but then some moisture got it the display and we needed to take it to Apple.To our surprise, the Apple technician pointed out that someone had opened this phone before to change the display and didnâ€™t do it correctly. So moisture was getting in the phone. Aside from that, whoever did it stripped the nails in the bottom of the phone so we have no way of fixing it.I contacted the seller but obviously since itâ€™s been months they are saying WE opened the phone and itâ€™s our fault.Just please be careful who you buy from. Itâ€™s bad enough to spend $500 on a phone that was broken.. but to then be accused of having opened it and broken it just too much. We never touched the phone until we took it to Apple.THE PHONE WAS SOLD TO US WITH STRIPPED NAILS AND A BAD DISPLAY INSTALLATION.",

  The phone itself looks like it was dropped a few times. Scratch is all over it scratched on the back. It's not refurbished like it comes from a recognized company. It's refurbished like it came from a friend that had it for a few years and decided to give it away because of how scratched up it has come. It is not working now and I'm about to send it back. The thing stopped turning on completely after putting a $80 case on it. Never dropping it. It practically never leaves my computer desk and still is having problems working. I don't understand this,

"  This phone is practically new. Absolutely no signs of use but a tiny scuff beside the flash on the back of the phone which doesn't hurt the usability and is barely noticeable. The battery is at 100% capacity. Packaged in generic box with a generic charger. When received, there was already a screen protector on the phone. Was able to set up with my carrier immediately. I use straight talk, all I had to do was transfer my information from my current iPhone to this one and move the SIM card from current phone to this one. The process took 10 min at most.",

I've bought my last two refurbished phones on Amazon and never had a problem. Not sure about these ""renewed"" phones. My son bought one a few months ago and his was fine.

Seriously considering running it over with my car,
"Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2021Size: 64GBColor: RedService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Save your $ and just buy a new phone. I was already having problems with an iPhone XR that I bought that was acting up when I decided to get this one to replace it. I was hoping the issues experienced with that phone would be resolved but unfortunately not. The microphone sometimes drops out and the phone often drops lots of calls. About once a call it cuts out completely for about 3-5 seconds (can't figure that one out). Now with the latest update it no longer calls out the turn by turn navigation with the native apple maps application. If apple is hoping that people wish rush out to buy a new piece of garbage like I did to replace the older problematic one- this isn't going to help them sell more phones. In fact, I may just be ready to migrate to the ""dark side"" and go get a Pixel 6 next!",

Great Savings Good Value,
"Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2020Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
  I waa skeptical about getting this iPhone because it was a renewed product and it was via Amazon not an iPhone dealer. My kid had received a couple of hundred dollars in Amazon gift cards and some cash for her birthday. I wanted her to have a new phone but I didn't want to be under a contract so purchasing was the best bet. I read the reviews and read up on the Amazon Renewed program and it seemed like a good deal. The gift cards helped defray the cost. She got what she wanted in perfect condition. I purchased the warranty for extra protection and we took it to Metro PCS by T-Mobile and they set it up without a hitch. I will use the Renewed program again. I saved about $100 over the cost of a new phone and was able to purchase a case and shield with change to spare.,

I was hesitant at first after reading some horrible reviews about other phones online, but this hasn't disappointed me yet. The phone arrived in excellent condition- like brand new. Ive had it almost 2 weeks now and I've had ZERO issues. I bought a separate case and screen protector - I've dropped it several times already (i'm clumsy) and it still held up great. No issues with the touch screen. The battery life is amazing!!!! If you have doubts, I hope my review helps you seal the deal :)",

  I was quite skeptical about buying an iPhone from here but when mine came in the mail those suspicions left. Mine came basically new with only a few tiny scratches. 100% battery life and everything worked perfectly! Totally worth it tbh,

Absolute Scam.,

  Please don't waste your money. This phone is a POS and was definitely tampered with in a malicious manner before being sold. After many months of owning this device here is my review:Pros:Works like a normal iPhone (for the most part until it doesnt after a few months)Main camera seems to be real and works good (surprisingly)The operating system works perfectly so farCons:Came in sketchy 3rd party phone box with 3rd party chargerTrue Depth Camera for Face ID was completely removed and replaced with a fake one.Volume very frequently bugs out and becomes quiet until you mess with it and goes back to normal then does the same thing over and over.Wifi & Cellular connection is really bad I frequently have to restart the device numerous times to make it connect to the internet again.Update: Phone has completely stopped working when under 50% battery and Screen is popping out of place on the left side.In Conclusion this phone is one of the biggest wastes of money Iâ€™ve ever spent. DO NOT BUY REFURBISHED PHONES ON AMAZON! I will revisit this review as more problems with this device very likely occur.,

Iâ€™m super happy with my new iPhone 11!,
"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2020Size: 64GBColor: YellowService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
  I love this so much ! The vendor was one of the only ones who had yellow iPhones available at a good price. I just upgraded from a iPhone 8 that I had for less then a week due to it size. Now this is everything I wanted and more. I love yellow lol. Also I was so happy to see there was a screen protector already in my phone. Like really? Thatâ€™s a win. I now have 4 extras just in case . Itâ€™s also a lot faster then my iPhone 8 and transferring my stuff  was eAsy.,

"  I brought three(3) of the phone for my family and they work okay for a month. After that month of use it become disaster because they all came down with a battery problem. The phone would literally shut down while I'm on important calls, it was extremely hotðŸ”¥ and the battery wasn't holding the charge. I personally replaced the battery with the original batteries and same thing occur. The reason I couldn't return was because I was out of the country and wouldn't be able to return in time.",

Absolutely Amazing!,
"Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2020Size: 64GBColor: GreenService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  So i'm going to be completely honest, i was extremely worried about spending the amount of money i did on amazon. But with that being said the phone arrived extremely fast, and is in close to Brand new condition with the exception of a tiny nick on the bottom right corner of the phone, which is no biggie at all. I have had the phone for about a month now and it has been ABSOLUTELY  AMAZING! no problems as of now and highly doubt there will be any... fingers crossed. side note It does not come in the original box or  at least mine didn't which for me personally is not a problem, just wanted to give a heads up. Highly recommend, Good luck!",

The phone Sucks The company sucks,
"Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2021Size: 64GBColor: PurpleService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  I bought this phone for $700 a couple of months after Apple released the iPhone 11.  This phone worked right for maybe 4-5 months. Now every 30 minutes it disables because the temperature is too hot. My phone loses connection every 30 minutes no matter how important I am in need of my phone to make calls, it loses service. I have service with straight talk. I have for years, as soon as I put this phone on their Phone service, it automatically started to give me problems. Straight talk has never led me to have issues but if you buy a phone from Electronic Deals from Amazon you'll definitely wind up with a whole lot of problems and wasted money.",

Arrived broken,
"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2022Size: 128GBColor: GreenService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  I thought these phones were checked and tested however the phone screen will glitch and type or delete different stuff than what was being typed. Camera and other apps will open or close on it's own. I'm assuming the phone had a screen replaced or something and was repaired wrong. Return process has been a big hassle and I'm about to call my bank to reverse charges. I checked Apple and I could have bought the exact same phone, brand new, for the exact same price. This seller should consider selling better phones and as these are referbs, sells for less than new. Will never buy a referb phone from Amazon again and am questioning Amazon all together as they couldn't help in the return process either.",

Good Phone,
"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2022Size: 128GBColor: GreenService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  My sister finally talked me into getting an IPhone.  For a 3 month return policy I thought, why not?  Not a techy gal by any means, so in a nutshell mine works well.  My battery was at 84% capacity when it arrived.  Very user friendly and like how I can connect easier to other IPhone users than when I had an android.  Have had it for a week now and like it a lot.  Still a little pricey for a phone but it does have a good camera and good responsiveness.  I love my color which is Green.  Also happy I went for the 128GB storage.  Will probably end up keeping itðŸ‘ðŸ»",

"  My first Apple product since the ipod.  Which still works BTW.  I suffered through a whole series of android phones.  Had issues with them.  Calls dropped, bad reception.  Calls I was waiting for going directly to voicemail.  I blamed my carrier and I was wrong.  It was the phones.Easy to use.  Better texting/fast fewer mistakes.  More intuitive.  So simple to pair accessories.  Just works effortlessly.  I have excellent reception and the phone works all the time.  It is reliable and it seems sturdy, not cheap.  I am now an Apple person.  My next computer will be Apple too.  I am done fighting with technology.  I want it to work for me and Apple does that.",

DO NOT BUY,
"Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2021Size: 64GBColor: PurpleService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Before buying I specifically selected ""unlocked"" when prompted to select a carrier. After hours of trying to activate and switch over my service, I spent another hour on the phone with my provider only to find out that the phone was locked. Then to make matter worse the phone would not allow me to log into the app store, or transfer my data over. I'll most likely return the phone because I am so angry about everything that I just went through. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It's a hassle and a half and you're most likely going to have to return it too.",

2nd time getting a faulty phone from hybrid IT my 1st experience was great so disappointing .,
"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2021Size: 64GBColor: GreenService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  I purchased the iPhone 11 from Hybrid IT a week ago , it arrived on time . As with any renewed phone I check to make sure everything is working , Cameras , Face recognition , Speakers . Everything was looking good then I went to see if the wireless charging works ,an it didnâ€™t connect . I thought well maybe itâ€™s my charger , So I took it to APPLE and low and behold the wireless charging back does not work .When buying renewed phones Iâ€™m aware there may be some cosmetic scuffs or scratches but when something is internally wrong with the phone like the last one sold to me with a broken speaker from hybrid . Are yaâ€™ll not checking your phones before you send them out bcs at this point it feels like it  ?? This is ridiculous .Iâ€™ve called them multiple times and they wonâ€™t answer I need a replacement phone or my money back!",

Battery lasted only one month!,
"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2021Size: 128GBColor: GreenService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  After a delay of two weeks of receiving the phone, and after getting it set up at my Verizon store, the battery lasted one month!  My Apple store told me it would take 5 days to get a new battery for the phone. I was so exasperated that I would be without a phone for that long I traded it in and bought the 12pro. Never again will I buy a refurbished phone! This really cost me.",

  Â The phone keeps on turning off and on over and over on its own when I open an app it keeps turning off and on over and over. Not worth buying. Returning the phone,

"Connectivity Issues, Random Restarts, and Touch Screen Problems",
"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2020Size: 128GBColor: GreenService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  After having this iphone 11 for just 3 days, I've come to realize that there are issues with the phone that were not addressed before it was sent to me. After fully resetting and updating the phone, checking the sim card with my service provider, and even taking it to multiple phone repair shops to have it checked... The phone still completely restarts without any warning up to 10 times in an hour. The device also seems to have some screen sensitivity issues and sometimes it will not respond to touch for several moments before working. On top of that, this phone hasn't been able to locate any of the bluetooth devices in my home that other members of the household are easily able to connect to.I honestly don't know what went wrong here considering all the other good reviews, but let's just say you're definitely taking a chance if you buy a refurbished phone. I guess I'm going to have to send this one in for a refund... an unfortunate waste of time.",

"If purchased from CPRTX, return inmediately and pray you don't get stolen.",
"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2021Size: 128GBColor: RedService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  I don't usually write bad reviews, specially ones that focus on the seller and not the product but I feel it's important for all of you to know my story.I purchased the Red 128GB iPhone 11 from CPRTX. The phone was barely used, inside an office but it was a needed line. A screen protector and cover were installed as the phone was being setup.Over a month of use, the screen started playing games. It would show random patterns or freeze but given that there were updates in between those days, I thought it had to do with updates. However, the issues would continue to happen more and more often and lasting longer so I decided to return, since it was obvious the screen was faulty.CPRTX decided the only thing they needed to return was 72 cents out of the $564 of the phone. Despite being covered by the A to Z Amazon Guarantee, I'm still fighting for my refund - and hope I don't get $565 stolen from them. They keep saying I damaged the phone but their own pictures show a pristine, perfect screen, except when turned on.Otherwise, the iPhone 11 was impeccable. You could tell they did some work by looking at the screws at the bottom but other than that, beautiful. The screen did not seem original but it was working great and so was everything else. You could not believe someone had used that phone before which confirms that there are people out there, like myself, who take really good care of their devices.iOS 14.6 works great in the iPhone 11 and the camera does a better job than the iPhone 6 Plus it replaced. You will also enjoy the added screen size (if you're coming from any of the iPhone Pluses) despite having a smaller device. I do miss TouchID and you will too. Overall, iPhone 11, a great phone. CPRTX - Thieves!So a big warning. Do not trust this (CPRTX) seller. They will do everything in their power to steal from you and do not care if the ship to you a faulty phone. They feel Amazon backs them up. I will update if something new happens.",

"  If there is ever a phone I was ever so pleased with, itâ€™s this one. I got it during quarantine time because I had accidentally put my old phone in the washer. Anyway, this phone is excellent for a refurbished. From face recognition, battery life span, camera quality, storage, I wouldnâ€™t ask for a better phone. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to but iPhone 11 for an affordable price, one year now and my phone is still intact. Bought another one for my brother and he was not disappointed. I also got them in their apple packaging with accessories which is unbelievable because I thought I wouldnâ€™t by the comments. 10 stars, get you this phone.",

  Phone came in amazing shape. It didnâ€™t come in itâ€™s original Apple box which is fine and it didnâ€™t come with the original apple charger which is also okay! It still came with a nice lengthy charger regardless. The phone has 100% battery capacity and it had absolutely no dents or scratches on it.,

,
"  Purchased this only to have the speaker go out in 4 months ( fitting since the seller ""warranty"" window is 3 months).  Took it to best buy and they wouldn't work on it because it is an international version.  Now I have to either pay $600 to fix a non-us version or but a new one.  I knew 8 was taking a chance on a ""renewed"" device, but this is ridiculous.  Worst decision ever buying this one.Word of advice, when buying a phone, verify with the serial number that it is in fact the correct version.",

Pretty Good Buy,
"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2020Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  So far so good, I have only had the phone a few days, the delivery process went smoothly. The phone did look fairly new the only give away was that it did not come in the apple box and I did not receive an original apple charger to use with it, but I purchased my own. For the price I feel like I did get a good deal, definitely better than paying over a thousand just for the original box and charger and earbuds, I believe that is all Iâ€™m missing. The phone did appear unlocked, I use AT&T and it works fine with it.",

"  First This phone is not unlocked, so that is a lie, it will no work with Verizon, and then it is shipped with fedex! FedEx is not reliable! The phone was supposed to be here 2 weeks ago, still a not here! Just buy a new phone and save yourself a lot of time. It is not worth the few bucks you save buying this one!",

Itâ€™s alright .,

"  I got this phone earlier than the estimated time which was nice cause I really needed a new phone. Everything works fine, was refurbished gr8tly. However, the whole purpose of looking for a phone was to make sure it was unlocked through any carrier. I go through boost and itâ€™s hard to get phones under boost so I normally look for unlocked phones. It says itâ€™s unlocked in packaging and on hereâ€¦ I began the activation process â€¦ and it wouldnâ€™t not let me I looked further and went to setting and under SIM card it said it was locked!!!! Itâ€™s disappointing because I have to go through so much to get it unlocked and now I canâ€™t even use the phone until then !!! The product was promoted as unlocked as well as the paper work that came with the phone! Itâ€™s just frustrating because I rely on my phone a lot. And to not have one is such an inconvenience especially after I paid for it to be unlocked which might not only cost me out of pocket but my time. I might as well have bought a phone from my carrier. But I love getting them from Amazon I got my last phone from here and had no issues but now itâ€™s like I donâ€™t want to even purchase phones from here anymore ! Iâ€™m really disappointed ðŸ¥º.",

Donâ€™t buy these,

  After a month or so the phone is horrible. Turns off all the time randomly. Amazon customer support has been useless as they tell me I have to take the phone to the apple store. I just want to send it back and go to my phone carrier and pay the extra for a phone that ACTUALLY works. I bought two of these and the other one is the exact same issues.Update: took both phones to apple and theyâ€™re both listed as MFG date for the year 1978. Apple said these phones were supposed to be sent back to apple for repairs and never made it and was â€œre-soldâ€ to me. Returning them as we speak to hopefully get a return ðŸ˜‘,

DO NOT BUY THESE PHONES,
"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2022Size: 256GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Seriously, pay a little more and buy new. The phone did not operate as expected. The phone would drop calls and once pictures were taken you couldn't get them off the phone using a USB cable. The phone would display an error every time you connected using a USB cable. This was tried using multiple computers and each time it would start the transfer and then error out. We are now having issues getting a refund. I am very disappointed and hope I can get a refund.",

  The phone is very nice looking and it was so easy to set up the phone. It took no time to set up phone and for all my stuff to show back up on here. I suggest that if u have a phone u should do the trade in option like i did because you can get money off the phone. Only problem I had is thatthe phone wasnâ€™t updated and I had to wait an hour to update the phone. But other than that overall nice phone! The seller was super nice btw and very helpful :) I will do a one month update on this phone so watch out for that. (Iâ€™ve had it for a week now)Update :Phone really isnâ€™t unlocked to all carriers but overall the phone is ok ig. Itâ€™s it works only with cdma networks ðŸ¤¦ðŸ½â€â™€ï¸ Not happy,

Not what I expected,
"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2022Size: 128GBColor: WhiteService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  This was a ""refurbished"" iPhone 11. The packaging was fine, professionally packed with all the included items as described. It had 81% battery life, also as described. However, as I was setting this phone up for my wife, I discovered the screen had been replaced with an ""unauthorized"" screen. As I was prepared to explain to my wife that the the ""big red balloon"" with the number 1 in setting was just fine, the phone locked up and would not restart, including a full reboot of the system. Returned to the seller the same day. Let's see if I get a refund properly.",

  I had the phone for less than a month and it worked beautifully but then it wouldn't turn on anymore wouldn't work no matter how long I charged it or where I took it. So I requested a refund and sent it back and it has been over a month and still no refund. Be careful guys.,

Brand new feel for a used price,

,
"  So far Iâ€™m very pleased with the iPhone 11 I received. I purchased an AT&T locked phone because it was cheaper and Iâ€™ve had so many bad experiencing buying â€œunlockedâ€ phones in the past that arenâ€™t unlocked.Anyway, Iâ€™m upgrading from an old iPhone 6s so by comparison everything seems super sleek and nice. My refurbished phone came to me undamaged and I did not find any nicks or scratches on it, it essentially looks brand new. Battery life seems amazing. The seller even put a screen protector on it, which was a super nice touch and I was not expecting it.",

Screen scratches,
"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2020Size: 64GBColor: WhiteService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Ok, let me start by saying I was really sketched out by ordering this. It still costs a pretty penny but youâ€™re unable to view the quality before hand. This by no means will receive a 5 star rating from me  not because it lacks the apple packaging and accessories but because it had minor scratching on the screen. Everything Else so far has been perfect but donâ€™t expect to get a flawless phone. a simple screen cover helped the scratch look but thatâ€™s not the point. The screens for the iPhone 11 are not oled so they are inexpensive to replace. There is no reason why based on this price tag that they couldnâ€™t have replaced the scratch screen as well. Overall , happy with the purchase but not blown away",

Great phone!,

  I received the phone two weeks ago and I was a little nervous after some of the reviews I've read about renewed phone. It came in a generic box and the phone was inside a bubble wrap package. I quickly inspected the phone and it was perfect. It looks practically brand new. It also came with free screen.  Booted the phone and completed the setup. Phone works great so far! Will keep everyone posted if anything change.,

  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.  Purchased a refurbished iPhone 11 and it never connected to cell service correctly until eventually it stopped working altogether.  I got a new SIM card and still nothing. Went to apple store and they ran diagnostics on it and found that the phone was faulty.  Had to spend $500 to replace the phone.  This seller is fraudulent.  Do not trust that they will sell you a working product.  Buyer beware,

"awful seller, grade C product is described as excellent like new condition.",

"  very visible scratch on screen at top right corner, seller described this junk as like new condition. I thought I am saving $80 dollars by getting a nice like new product but was very disappointed. Packaging was done by a 3-4 years old for sure. whoever think this junk is in new condition need to have their eyes checked. Total waste of time.",

Good device,
"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2021Size: 128GBColor: PurpleService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Reviews ask for battery life, facial recognition, and fingerprint reader. The facial recognition software and fingerprint reader are ios software so that should be the same across all devices. That being said they both work as they should on the device. The device was in great shape, looked like a phone I would get at the store of my service provider. But my black and red service provider doesn't sell devices outright, so here we are. Order her this as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend and upon powering it up, setting it up I am more than happy with the purchase. If you need a bare device these guys sell a good product, no scratches, no cracks, full functionality etc. Came with the new USB c charger block and cord wrapped, and the Sim card tool. Looks brand new and the price was decent. I am satisfied.",

  It didn't work out of the box. The number 8 wouldn't work and the downloading of software from the old phone had to be restarted 3 times. Returned it. Bought a 10 refurbished from iPhone. The return was easy so they do stand behind their product and the refund was prompt.,

Good Deal,
"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2021Size: 128GBColor: RedService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  This iPhone 11 came at a great price and it was in pretty good condition. Not great, but that is to be expected from a refurbished iPhone. Has a few scratches here & there, but nothing too major. The battery was at 93% of its life; therefore, it is still really good. Everything works on the iPhone and more importantly my daughter was able to upgrade from an 8 to the 11 without us having to agree to a new contract with AT&T.",

Great for the price ! A steal,
"Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2020Size: 128GBColor: YellowService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",

  Almost like new! It had a couple light scratches in the back and a bit deeper one on the  bottom side (not the screen but on the gold/black part) it isnâ€™t anything to be upset about since itâ€™ll be covered by a case and isnâ€™t that visible unless you look for it.The phone heats up a little bit sometimes but Iâ€™ve noticed itâ€™s when Iâ€™m holding my phone more by the middle. Works great! Make sure to update the software or the apps wonâ€™t load,

Awesome Vendor For Awesome Phone,
"Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2020Size: 256GBColor: PurpleService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  I havenâ€™t owned an iPhone since the first generation. Iâ€™ve been an android baby for years since then. That said, theyâ€™ve made iPhone controls way easier to learn and handle since then. I was a bit skeptical to swap over, but itâ€™s definitely worth dropping Android for the smooth experience.This vendor shipped the phone in perfect condition, no scratches, battery life was perfect. It also arrived close to 2 days earlier than the original estimate. Very pleased with this purchase, when the time comes to grab a new phone for my wife, I know exactly where to order from.",

  At first I was a little bit skeptical about buying this phone from a random seller but I still proceeded to purchase the phone. I'm so glad I did because the phone came in PERFECT condition. No scratches or cracks anywhere along the phone. It even came with a screen protector on the phone and even one for the back camera.,

"  I usually never do reviews, I just read them, but for the people wondering if this phone is a good purchase or not after reading these. I say step out on faith because it was most def a good purchase .I got the standard shipping ( cheaper ) & it was supposed to deliver a week later, but I received it the next day.The battery life was at 0% which is no big deal for me, I don't really trip about stuff like that.I expected it to not be in the original box & only have the charging cable, but I received it w/ a charging block as well & it wasn't in the original box. It was absolutely perfect as if nobody had used it.The camera is amazing, by far the best & cheap purchase . It took it a minute to transfer and update, but besides that it's been good.I was also concerned it about it not being unlocked fully as tho I seen several reviews that said their's wasn't, but mine definitely came unlocked. I'm very grateful for it & I'll be back with a week update .",

Buy brand new instead.. itâ€™s about the same cost for better quality,
"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2021Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Eh. In my opinion, itâ€™s just as expensive as a brand new phone but it appears gently used. T-Mobile full price was 599.. this phone (shipping + cost+taxes) was 592.. It came with a non brand charger, itâ€™s got minor scratches on the screen and some around the border. Battery is alright. Fortunately, nothing major. It shipped next day for me so that was good. Iâ€™m still debating sending it back but set up takes a while so you contemplate keeping it. I was a little worried about security but it seems alright...",

  Great product so far Iâ€™ve been waiting some time to write this review because people say it breaks after a week to a month itâ€™s been a little over a week and itâ€™s been great looks brand new no issues whatsoever Iâ€™ll keep you updated however.Continued: about a month later idk Iâ€™ve been having connectivity issues. It isnâ€™t that big of a deal but itâ€™s too much of a hassle to be sent a new phone so I make do but Iâ€™ll probably end up getting a new one.,

87% Battery Capacity upon delivery,
"Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2022Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  I received the phone on January 13th. I have been using it for a couple weeks, so that it could run the battery performance check. Once completed it is now showing that my battery health is at 87% of maximum capacity. It is now January 30th as of this review. Concerning as I will have to then, presumably replace my battery within the year, probably just outside of the 3 month warranty window. I understand itâ€™s a refurbished phone, but you would think they would at least swap the battery out with a new one or run a performance diagnostic. Everything else is mediocre-to-fine.  Issues with swiping up to get to Home Screen, odd lock-upâ€™s and having to close apps, issues with facial unlock, etc... Semi-minor things such as that. I gave it 3 stars because itâ€™s running okay (possibly even as expected), but the battery is rather concerning, as thatâ€™s the reason I upgraded to a new model in the first place.",

  I bought this phone yesterday since I had broken my other phone and needed a new one fast. But since getting it hooked up and working yesterday (the same day I received it)  the earpiece is scratchy and distorted to the point that you cant hear the person's words when they talk.  Seller so far has not been easy to work with and this is not worth the money.,

iphone that last only 5 months,
"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2022Size: 64GBColor: PurpleService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
  It is a rebuilt item that claims to be new and is fine in appearance and functionality but it only lasted 5 months. I told the provider about this and he did not reply. Be careful buying in this store as there is a risk of losing your money. I have bought about 50 items in the year on Amazon which makes me a good buyer and this supplier is the only one who did not offer me anything in return,

Seller needs to be more detailed,
"Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2021Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
  The iPhone 11 does not allowed to activate the SIM card. We went to our telephone provider and they told us that the SIM is block. I called our telephone provider and technician  indicated that this phone is not allowing our SIM card to activate. I do not think this phone is fully unlock to use it. So I am going to return it to the seller and hope they need to fix this issue so that customers are not wasting their time and money.,

Speakers,
"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2022Size: 64GBColor: GreenService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  The speakers donâ€™t work like they are suppose too. The battery life on the phone isnâ€™t what is should be. The phone did come with a screen protector, which is very good! The phone should at least be checked for faults before sending out at least if your going to pay the amount your paying for just my opinion at least.",

Scam!! Do not buy from this seller.,
"Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2021Size: 128GBColor: RedService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Straight out of the box, the phone did not work. The seller told me I just needed to updated the phone. Jumped through hoops trying to update and reset the phone with no success.  According to Apple, the phone was over 1500 days out of warranty.  Not sure how that is possible since the iPhone 11 was released less than 2 years ago. Do not buy from this seller. It's a scam!!",

Damaged replaced easily. New phone is perfect!,
"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2020Size: 128GBColor: GreenService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  UPDATE: return and refund went smoothly. New phone works perfectly, no issues!According to Apple this is a faulty device that needs to be replaced. It randomly powers down and they say it's a logic board problem that cannot be fixed. I'm hoping the seller will contact me ASAP to exchange the phone for a product that is not damaged. If so I will update my review to reflect that. This was my Mothers' Day gift. Kind of sucks that it's broken.",

Awesome deal!,
"Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2021Size: 128GBColor: RedService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Phone works great and it arrived early with super fast shipping!  I was kinda bummed it came with only  89% battery life-Iâ€™m jealous of the people who got the 100% battery-but seriously-this is a great deal; my carrier tried to sell me the same phone for almost $1,200 with a contact. The one downside to the iPhone 11 (to me anyway) is that there is no headphone jack.  Love the facial recognition-waitâ€¦ thereâ€™s a fingerprint reader?! I had no idea.",

Fake IPhone broke right after return date closed.,
"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2021Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Right off the bat I knew something wasnâ€™t right, the speakers werenâ€™t loud, camera wasnâ€™t up to par and the screen had a light spot in it all compared to my girlfriends iPhone 11. Fast forward 4 months later shortly after the return window closed for the phone it stoped working. The cellular data is locked out making it unable to do anything until I â€œupdate itâ€ even though we fixed and update to the latest iOS. We took it to both an AT&T store and an apple store where they then informed us that itâ€™s not even a real iPhone 11. I would not recommend buying this and donâ€™t see how this is not illegal in some form of way.",

Phone came in Flawless shape but battery life was not !,
"Reviewed in the United States on September 21, 2021Size: 64GBColor: PurpleService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  So I was very skeptical only because this would be my second purchase through amazon . The first time was ordering for my mother in law and it turned out fine for her , physically flawless phone with great battery life. For me on the other hand the battery life was disappointing and I feel like the speakers are bit off like it was renewed from water damage possibly. Also the phone wasnâ€™t all the way unlocked . Though I can use it fine and my SIM card works , for some reason it wonâ€™t fully register with my provider online and when I chatted with an agent through Verizon they said my phone was non-Verizon device and they were unable to unlock it which again begs the question is it truly unlocked? Or was there a loophole and I can still use it properly with no problem. Will be returning only because the storage is not enough in comparison to my old phone but Iâ€™ve read that itâ€™s a hit or miss when returning these phone so wish me luck !",

  This is my second time buying an Iphone from Amazon sellers.  The first phone I bought was a Iphone 6 in 2017 and up to today it lasted me with no problems but I needed a new upgraded phone with a better cÃ¡mara and all new features.  I decided to try this seller and purchased my Iphone 11 which didn't come in the original box but who cares the phone is working perfectly fine for the price I paid it is worth it.  Really happy with it.  Thank you.,

Worth it considering itâ€™s refurbished & phone company canâ€™t bill me payment plans.,
"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2021Size: 64GBColor: GreenService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Iâ€™m overall happy. I havenâ€™t had it for a month yet, but when receiving it, the battery was at 92% health, which is still good, for what I need. The customer service was quick to get back regarding a question I had in date of purchase. Iâ€™m not able to get Applecare since the date of purchase is not updated, but I donâ€™t need phone insurance.There werenâ€™t any scratches or knicks. I ordered, used like new. There isnâ€™t any lag when using the phone. No glitches. I did have a hard time updating the phone at first. I had to start over (transferring content from my old phone) , but once I did that, and got back to the update portion, everything went smoothly. I thought I had a lemon, but it is indeed exactly what I need. For $589, used-like new, and refurbished, this is what I hoped for.",

BIG SCRATCH ACROSS THE SCREEN!,
"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2021Size: 64GBColor: WhiteService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",

  I got a product that goes against the guarantee written in the description of the product. It says there will be no visible imperfections when the phone is held from arms length. I could see the scratch all the way down the hallway in my home. I am attempting to get a refund and they won't reimburse me the full amount that I spent. I have yet to find out if they will charge me a fee for the return of there product that was falsely advertised.,

Donâ€™t waste your time these are just repackaged used phones. Nothing â€œrenewedâ€ about them,
"Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2021Size: 64GBColor: RedService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",

  Screen is covered in tiny scratches. Looks like it was kept in someoneâ€™s pocket constantly with keys. I can tell the phone was taken apart at some point because there are pry marks on the side of it. For $530 I should have just spent the extra $130 to buy a brand new one.,

  So my phone has been working great since I bought it in May 2020. I take great care of it. I have a case on it. It hasnâ€™t gotten wet or anything. I did the new update recently and it was fine at first but the cellular isnâ€™t working. Apple said it was a hardware issue.,

DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS SELLER,
"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2021Size: 256GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Horrendous customer service and equally bad products!!! Every device (whether purchased or warranty replaced) has been defective. Verizon even told us with this last device that they did not even recognize the serial numbers for the phone).The phone worked fine for 2 months before starting to have problems. It will not send / receive data unless connected to Wi-Fi ... even with an unlimited plan and full coverage area. Yes, we are 2 werks past the refund period ... but you would certainly think this seller would try to make things right by sending a replacement (which, by the way, would be the 4th phone in a few month period). All they do is blame Amazon for their policies (instead of giving appropriate customer service).A waste of $600!!!Be wise and DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER.",

  I received my refurbished iPhone and on the screen I noticed a deep scratch so I felt it with my finger and it was smooth as there was no scratch there was a screen protector over the phone when I received it so I pulled the screen protector back and yes it is a deep scratch more of a crack than a scratch small crack I wouldnâ€™t even care if it was on the back of the phone but on the front screen is unacceptable thatâ€™s the part that Iâ€™m actually going to be looking at and itâ€™s annoying and it is not cheap to replace hoping to return for a different phone or return for a full exchange  or refund me partial of my money to fix the broken screen other than that Phone seems fine hooked it up use it for a day easy check out fast shipping the usual Amazon,

Respond quickly & great service,

,
"  We had an issue with calls hearing them, during the 90 day period and they were awesome in getting a replacement next day after me shipping the defective one back. They respond to messages immediately and are very nice to work with! Other than that one little issue there was nothing wrong with the phone at all in perfect condition. If I order refurbished again I will definitely be going through them",

Defective phones...ruined my sister day.,
"Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2021Size: 64GBColor: WhiteService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
  I am dissapointed.. i had 2 unlocked iphone 11 (excellent condition) purchased from here but both had major issues. First which i already replaced had touchscreen issue and now my second white iphone 11 has network issue which i purchased for my sister as gift. Reason i am really upset is because it took away smile from her face as soon as we found phone was defective after several tries  it still didnt show network..  I guess i have to replace second phone as well but it wont be same as the occasion is already passed..,

  Its just like a brand new phone except:  battery potential is limited at 89% and it came with a generic box and charger.  I'm totally satisfied- the price was right.  Thank you amazon.,

"Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2021Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Phone came with screen seriously scratched. It says that they have minor blemishes that are ""not visible when held at arms length."" But that is BS as this phone had pretty serious scratches on the screen. Other blemishes would be fine, but not on the screen. Will be sending back for a replacement, since they already have my money and I know it will be a pain to get a refund.",

"  Phone is defective and Iâ€™ve contacted the seller several times and have not heard back. The phone wonâ€™t stay on and is stuck in a reboot loop. My other phone is broken, hence why I ordered this one and now I have to wait to receive a refund to order another since my phone call and support requests have gone unanswered. I donâ€™t like leaving bad reviews but Iâ€™m extremely frustrated and this hasnâ€™t been resolved.",

"Great Phone, Terrible Seller",
"Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2021Size: 64GBColor: PurpleService Provider: T-MobileProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  The phone itself is nice, there are a few tiny scratches on the corner but they're not noticeable at all. I've had it for about a week and everything works fine, the battery health is at 90% and lasts for awhile between charges which is nice. I took off a couple stars because of shipping issues; for some reason my phone was unable to be delivered the 1st time and was returned to the shipper, so I had to contact the seller to send me a new one. This whole process took about 3 weeks which was super annoying, and the seller never explained why the first phone had to be sent back. Overall I would recommend buying this phone but avoiding this seller.",

"  This phone is supposed to have no scratches visible at arms length.  Not true.  Very very visible scratches.  However it is a good phone and a glass screen protector will cover them.  Was a bit disappointed to see such visible scratches, but it was at a discount.  I guess you get what you pay for.",

Too much money for poor service and response time!!!!,

,
"  IPhone is in excellent physical/visual condition. However, if I pay the price that is sooo close to the Apple cost then why do I have all these problems?!! Even if the purchase is a ""risk"" (because it's renewed/refurbished) Why take so long to respond to help resolve issues?!!! This is frustrating!!! I've contacted my carrier and the phone is indeed unlocked but something on the inside is not working properly. But can't get this resolved in a reasonable amount of time because this company doesn't respond in a reasonable amount of time!!!!!!!!!",

Not too bad,

  This was not an entirely as purchase my only issue is sometimes the screen jumps. Itâ€™s not very often but Iâ€™ve noticed or a few times. Also there is this weird thing that happens when I try to record videos with audio. There is this sound that overpowers the real time audio and it makes it difficult when recording. Other than that there were no noticeable scrapes on the phone. It came packaged well with a charger and set up was easy.,

A bit disappointed in the screen condition and battery health,
"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2022Size: 64GBColor: RedService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  I've purchased refurbed iPhones in the past and always have been happy with the cosmetics of the phones and the battery health.  This purchase was disappointing as there were numerous scratches on the upper right screen corner as well as what looks like small divots worn into the screen in a few places (like it constantly rubbed on something in a purse or pocket).  In addition, the battery health was at 89% (within the 80% spec Amazon has), but I've never received a phone with less than 95% life.  This is why I only rated this purchase a 3 star, however, it was delivered quickly as promised.",

"  I LOVE MY IPHONE 11!!! I bought my iphone 11 from here and i was a bit nervous, iâ€™ve never purchased a phone outside of a phone store so i had my concerns. I read many many reviews on amazon and found this to be the best reviews. I am not disappointed! My screen is not cracked/not scratched, battery life is good, the camera is astounding and I adore the color! I highly recommend purchasing your phone from here. The only hang up I had was getting it set up with verizon, phone issues are never simple however so i kind of expected that. The customer service struggled with switching over my account to another account though, so that has nothing to do with the phone itself. Phone works great on verizon service!",

The only thing missing was the little tool to get to the Sim card but I guess if thatâ€™s The worst thing that could happen Iâ€™m OK with it. Still hoping they send me one though after reading this review,

Poor communication for return/refund from a bad iphone from day 1,

,
"  I ordered an iphone 11 and the day I activated it, I could barely hear notifications, rings, people on the phone, and it kept freezing on screens. I was trying to contact Buyspry, Marketplace, and any combination of those to get help for a return/refund of over $600, followed all instruction on the booklet provided, and there were always pieces of information missing in order to complete the return.  I'm still waiting for the return label they said was provided in a recent message but have no idea where it's provided as they stated.  They won't reply to the phone number given and are stalling until the return date is too late. Stay away from buyspry!",

  Buyer beware... be very careful buying these refurbished phones. I received mine which was supposed to be able to be used on T-Mobile's network. I took it into the store to link it to my plan and was informed that it could not be used because it is currently registered to another user.  So it either was not wiped clean or was stolen. Returned and received a refund.,

  The product works great and everything but I checked the battery health on the iPhone and it was at 65% battery health. For a iPhone that is supposed to be refurbished they didn't replace the battery. Which means  I have to spend more money to get the battery replaced. Not happy that they didn't replace the battery. DO NOT BUY.,

That the back of the phone is dirty when I open the box.,
"Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2021Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  The phone delivery faster than a day that Amazon estimate. The battery life is 100% very good. But the phone is very dirty in the back, especially in the camera part. And the memory has been used 11GB for something that I do not know. I do not see any headphones here but it is all right no big problem. The fully unlock that I pick for the phone is working well with the T-Mobile sim card. The charge that Amazon provides charge phone really slow to get to 100% but I already have a wireless charger so no big issue with that. All of the things that I list above about the product that I buy make me feel happy because this is a trusted place to buy the phone. But I think you should buy an iPhone 12, the same price but better color than iPhone 11.",

It performs with a very poor connection with any kind of device, either audio or any other type; connection with  get's dropped once and again at a short distance, less that a meter, so even my new generation headphones I had to be replaced by the old cord headphones from my old iPhone 7.For the rest it's ok, battery, camera, speakers, processing.If you don't mind to have this kind of issues for the price, then it's a good option, but if you cannot cope with it then do not risk your money and buy a new packaged item considering to pay in full.",

I had used it just minutes ago and it was sitting in my purse and then it no longer functioned. I tried all the recommended Apple ""fixes"", to no avail. I took it to the Apple store.Sadly, the phone is not able to be repaired unless hundreds of dollars are spent. It is NOT a software issue, it is the hardware.

  Overall Iâ€™m very pleased with my newest purchase from this seller! I upgraded my phone from a 6s to this Unlocked 11. It made a world of difference (clearly lol). Setup and Transfer of my data/photos from my old phone to this one was painless. For those that are using Metro PCS by T Mobile  or a similar carrier save yourself some time and frustration and call customer service or login in to your personal account and ACTIVATE your unlocked device to your current account. Will definitely purchase from this seller again.,

Every time someone calls me and I answer the call, the screen just shuts off and I wouldnâ€™t be able to do anything to it for a couple of minutes.it can last for at least 30 minutes. So the trick is I have to be the one to make the call thatâ€™s the way to stop it. I guess I can tolerate this but hopefully no more issues comes up.",

Absolutely worth the buy,
"Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2020Size: 128GBColor: YellowService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
  I have to say I was skeptical when purchasing this phone but I absolutely love it. It came with a screen protector already applied as well as a charger. It has no scratches to the screen or any other part of the phone also battery was at 100%. Absolutely love this phone. Thank you,

,
"  So far no complaints.  However, there's much to learn and no manual included or available from Apple (which I find reprehensible). So, being an iPhone 'newbie' I had to buy a written manual.  All I can say is, to use this thing properly , it will require A LOT of further study.  It's amazing all the things this phone can do!",

Camera makes static noise and shakes horribly!,

,
  Camera is totally messed up. I thought these were supposed to be verified to work properly? I am returning and ordered another one. Hopefully the next one works. Check everything when you receive your phone because this obviously was not checked very well. Camera makes a static noise and shakes. Totally unusable.,

"  Not gonna lie; I was sooooo skeptical about ordering a renewed phone... it took me maybe 4 or 5 days of reading EVERY review, checking ALL ratings and so on and then just basically said screw it weâ€™ll cross that bridge when we get to it.WELL, letâ€™s just say... the phone was PERFECT!! Not a single scratch, crack, blemish.. like seriously looks like itâ€™s brand new. EVERYTHING works BEAUTIFULLY on this phone including the camera and I am VERY VERY impressed. The ONLY issue I do have is the batter life... it takes FOREVER TO  FREAKING CHARGE to where you see green but itâ€™s something I willing to deal with considering I paid a good price and everything about this is damn near brand new",

"  I thought I was going to be lucky. Usually I ignore reviews, DONT IGNORE! This phone was not fully unlocked and it had stated it was even in the settings. It lied, spent too much money trying to get it fixed. Not worth it at all. I am very disappointed, hope to get my money back or any sort of compensation. Don't go through the tears and trials that I did. Very upset with this product wish it was better.",

  Phone was in nice shape except for a few very light scratches on the screen. This is a known issue with the iPhone 11 so I was not surprised. The scratches are insignificant and can't be seen when the phone is being used. They are only visible when the screen is black. Shipping and communication were very good.Not an iPhone fan bought this for my wife and she likes it.,

Wi-Fi?,
"Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2021Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  I had the phone for about a week and started noticing some issues with the Wi-Fi but would just reset my phone. One day the phone wouldn't let any calls or texts go through I ended up having to go to my phone carrier and see if they could help me and they got it working for a good 5-10min and the it went right back to not doing anything staying that there was no signal. I couldn't get onto any of my apps because there was no connection but when I went into the network settings, it said it was connected to the Wi-Fi. I'm very unclear about the issue but now I have to deal with sending it back to amazon and waiting to purchase the same kind through my phone carrier. I had bought an iPhone 7 off of Amazon and it works great still!",

Visible scratches held at an armâ€™s length,
"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2020Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  I know this is a second hand product but honestly I expected a device without visible scratches held at an armâ€™s length, as the description says. When I received the phone I immediately saw there was a lot of really noticeable scratches around the bumper. It came with a screen protector which is good, but I removed it to check the screen condition and I also found some scratches, fortunately that's a good way to hide them.So far the phone is 100% functional I haven't had any trouble, it's fully unlocked as advertised and it came with the battery life at 100% which is perfect!I bought this phone from BuySPRY and I'm giving this review just 3 stars due to the noticeable scratches. Just for reference I had the opportunity to buy another refurbished iPhone from Chubbiestech in the past and they sent me a mint condition device, unfortunately this seller wasn't available when I bought the iPhone 11 but it is now. Maybe you'll have to pay a little bit more but it's definitely worth it!",

  Do not waste your money on this phone. It says internationally unlocked but it's crap. It is not reliable. One minute it works the next minute no service. The phone came with the screen chipped around the edge and it has been downstream since. The sellers are terrible.,

"  Well to begin with, he display glass they a installed on this â€œRenewedâ€ iPhone 11 was priced right , as I tried to set it up, however I discovered whyâ€¦ The display glass that they installed on the phone is not an Apple display there for several of the apps and a lot of the facial recognition feature donâ€™t work and the error message just keeps flashing app on my phone itâ€™s ridiculous I donâ€™t recommend you by any of the renew towns from this company",

MUST BUY!,

,
"  I was kinda hesitant on buying bc of some of the reviews, but definitely made the right choice in ordering.No scratches & minimal damage on the frame for a refurbished phone. Definitely looks new.I got it on time! Even felt like it was super fast shipping.Came with charging cable & box AND was super surprised it had a screen protector.Definitely is unlocked & had no issues connecting to my carrier. Phone seems to work perfect so far.SUPER GLAD I UPGRADED FROM MY IPHONE 7!This product is so good, Iâ€™m recommending to all that will listen lol!",

The touch screen did not work.,

"  The phone's touch screen completely non-functional out of the box. There were no cracks but since the device didn't register any touch, I was never able to get past the initial setup screen (even after restarts). In their defense, they did offer a refund though unfortunately I was too busy to send it in time. I'm not saying all of their phones come broken but I figure it's worth mentioning that mine was.",

  Phone as described I definitely recommend this product no noticeable dents or scratches on the screen. Does show wear but only when closely inspected not just from looking at the phone. So far itâ€™s good this is my first day using the device so if anything changes Iâ€™ll update my review.,

NOT like new,
"Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2021Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  This product claimed that the phone was like new, and it was not at all as advertised. The phone had a very noticeable scratch on the back, which is annoying, but what really got to me is that the camera doesn't work. Whenever I open the camera to use it, the camera keeps attempting (and failing) to adjust. It vibrates the phone profusely and makes it so that I can only use the front facing camera on this phone. Absolutely not worth the price.",

Battery life is at 100% health, screen, body of the phone are completely unharmed as if I had just bought it straight from apple. Also, it even came with tempered glass already on the screen which is an added plus!! I'm so so happy I purchased my phone here.",

Heavy and clunky compared to the Pixel 3a I was using before this iPhone 11, plus the camera isn't any better than what I had with my $250 Pixel -- both shoot decent wide angle photos and video, decent processing capabilities, and both have crappy digital zoom functionality. Mostly got this for the better integration with hearing aids.",

Totally Recommend,
"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2022Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  It came in a really obscure android box which got me sweating a little bit but when I opened it, I was more than happy. It looked brand new. It came with a screen protector already on it and with the charging adapter and chord. The setup was good, and Iâ€™ve been using it for 2 months. The only thing I can say that was a little annoying was that it took forever to charge and the charger adapter stopped working which is an easy fix. You can always buy a new adapter if you really so choose which is what I did and Iâ€™ve been happy ever since. So if youâ€™re going to buy this and need confirmation itâ€™s worth it, this is it.",

The battery capacity was 90%. Other than that the screen looks like new, the face recognition and the camera works fine.Itâ€™s a refurbished phone so you get what you get. You wonâ€™t know the condition of the phone until you get it. I was looking for a relatively new phone for a cheaper price so I donâ€™t mind with the phone I got, but if scratches and battery life are a concern for you, you might want to buy it from apple refurbished or just get a new phone.",

Itâ€™s has scratches and not full battery lifeâ€¦,
"Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2021Size: 64GBColor: GreenService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Itâ€™s not bad for a refurbished phone however, I would call this grade B refurbished. Most refurbished items I buy come from Walmart and I never have a problem. They always seem to be in perfect condition. It did come with a tempered glass which was a plus but when I went to put it on I immediately noticed lots of scratches on the screen. Iâ€™m assuming the screen was never replaced. The battery life is at 90% which means they donâ€™t replace the batteries either. Iâ€™m a little disappointed with my experience because Iâ€™ve never had this happen before. I recommend if you are wanting something more â€œnewâ€ like because this is DEFINITELY in used condition.",

Great iPhone !,
"Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2021Size: 64GBColor: PurpleService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Bought this unlocked iPhone with skepticism after reading the reviews. The phone looks like brand new, no scratches. Bought a SIM card from my phone carrier and so far has met my expectations. I only charge it once a day which is great, compared to the other iPhones I had. Purple color is beautiful, looks more like lavender. Amazon customer tech support was very helpful and even connected me with Apple support to obtain help with the data transfer from my old phone. A great buy at a reasonable price!",

Awesome Phone,
"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2021Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Phone works great but it has some minor scratches and an unfortunate ding on the bottom. Not too big of a deal for a refurbished phone. But the final price of $500 is a bit high for a used phone. I only got this one due to it being a lot faster than waiting for new ones to be in stock, if they even still make them.",

"  Value for the money, it had a couple of scratches in the back but barely noticeable otherwise the phone runs good fully unlocked looks almost like new . The only complain I have about this phone is that the charger that comes with it, is not an Apple charger is just those cheap chargers you could buy at the dollar store. it does charge with it, but be ready to buy a new one soon after",

Looked great, worked etc.  This week without being dropped, wet, or anything suddenly the battery literally swelled which caused the face of the phone to fall off.

I would definitely buy again from this seller and recommend to other potential buyers.For a quality item with a reasonable price and fast shipping, I would rate this transaction  A+",

"  Worked as advertised.  As a refurbished iPhone, you are always worried that it may not work as well as a new iPhone.  I have been pleasantly surprised with the overall condition and performance of the device.  The savings and the warranty were attractive enough for me to take the risk.

"Yup its an iPhone, just as it should be.",

"  Great phone, could not tell it was refurbished, came with a screen protector on it. The only bummer is that it did not come with ear pods but I noticed Apple is no longer giving those out either, so it's all good! It turned out to $40 cheaper than a new phone, and with some Amazon credits I had I would up getting a $600 phone for about $420, go refurb!",

WELL WORTH MY MONEY,
"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2020Size: 128GBColor: RedService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
  Product came in earlier than expected. These iPhones are good as new and I recommend these to anyone looking to purchase an iPhone. I bought 1 for myself and another for my girlfriend and they were both beautiful and in perfect condition. I was also pleased to see that both came with a screen protector installed. I am very satisfied with this product and I suggest this product to anybody looking to get a basically brand new iPhone for a better price.,

"So far, so terrible",
"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2022Size: 64GBColor: GreenService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  The first phone i received looks great, but had countless issues. The ""i"" key wouldnt work, the phone wouldnt charge intermittently, the screen would freeze every few hours. Very annoying issues. Decided to get a replacement and the shipment has been delayed 3x now. Will be sending this one back and be out of a phone for at least a week. Will report back when I get the replacement. My family has bought refurbished phones multiple times with no issue, but I had to write an honest review so far.",

  At first I was hesitant to buy an iPhone over the Internet but to my amazement this is one of the best purchases Iâ€™ve ever made.  Phone looks brand new no scratches no dents everything works flawlessly.  I bought the iPhone 11 in purple and I canâ€™t believe all the things it does compared to my iPhone 7.  Stop searching youâ€™ve found your new iPhone from this company!!,

Good phone,
"Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2020Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Great value, screen sometimes doesnâ€™t want to operate like it freezes up sometimes and I have to close out of the app I was in or sometimes itâ€™s slow a little but I can live with it. Everything is in perfect working order and screen is in great condition came with a screen protector. Awesome phone, wish the battery life was a little longer though, last maybe two-three hours using it. Checking my phone and going on every now and then last about ten hours, so not too bad.",

"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2021Size: 128GBColor: GreenService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
  I love my new iphone! The video quality is so good and there are so many accessories that i can get to go with it. People can't believe i shoot all my IG content on this phone or how fast I produce the content. Between the audio accessories I bought and music features on garageband I shoot and edit right in Imovie which has green screen features now and export so quickly. I even shot a music video in my GARAGE that no one believed was actually my garage because Imovie did such a dope job with it's green screen. Highly recommend especially for this refurbished price.,

  Screen had black spot lower right corner. SIM card port didnâ€™t work verified by apple support. Apple support was the one who urged me to get a refund or exchange. 70 dollars more for a brand new iPhone will save you a lot of headache.,

,
"  I chose this seller because of 100% positive feedback but my phone is not compatible with the carrier it was sold as being exclusively for. When I tried to activate the phone I found out it is incompatible with my AT&T SIM card. I spent 2 hours on chat with support but they were just talking in circles and I was never convinced they even understood the problem. If someone pays almost $500 for an item, it should be as described. Further, there was extensive cosmetic damage. I honestly would've overlooked the damage if the phone had actually worked.",

When trying to set up the phone, would not update to the latest IOS. Would not let you skip around. Gave option to return in exchange for new phone. Hope that one is functioning.",

"Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2021Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  When I was looking for a new phone, I didnâ€™t care that it was renewed. Iâ€™ve never had problems with renewed phones. So I came here first. I saw so many misleading things about these phones. But I made the purchase anyway. The phone came with 97% battery life, no scratches, no dents, and it was completely unlocked. Basically brand new. And I LOVE IT. I nervously waited for the package. And when i finally got it and everything was perfectly fine with it. I was amazed. So many people had said, so many misleading things. But truth is? IT AMAZING. GO FOR IT!",

Badly scratched,
"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2021Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Purchased this phone for relative who was leaving the country and needed an unlocked phone while traveling overseas. It was shipped fast, arrived on time but was very disappointing  to see very clear signs of wear and tear. The phone had scratches everywhere, which you would expect since it wasnâ€™t new but a huge scratch on the top right side of the screen was shocking. The phone actually looked like it had been abused. I wanted to return it but couldnâ€™t because the person whom it was for had to leave the country the next day.",

Not one scratch or mark and if your has one on it, it possibly could have came from the delivery truck or processor rather than the manufacturer. Iâ€™m very pleased with this purchase and I would recommend this product to anyone who does not want to spend 1,000 just on a phone.",

Great product,
"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2021Size: 64GBColor: RedService Provider: AT&TProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Phone arrived quickly, it looked brand new. It even had a screen protector and AppleCare for the next 6 months which we didnâ€™t know we were getting either. Also, the charger it came with looks to be a fast charger and it does charge the phone super fast. The only con is that the battery life is already at 86, but that is expected considering itâ€™s refurbished. We were a little hesitant considering there wasnâ€™t too many reviews, but so far we are extremely happy with the product. We will buy from seller again in the future.",

Amazing phone and highly recommend,
"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2021Size: 128GBColor: PurpleService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  I ordered this phone because I was due for a new one, and I needed more storage space. I came across this one and I thought it was a great deal but was nervous about it being renewed. I read all the reviews and the only doubts I had was when the battery life wasnâ€™t at 100%, with the phone being renewed, it states very clearly that it wouldnâ€™t come in the original Apple box or the Apple charger and cube. So when the reviews were bad about that, it was clear they didnâ€™t read the complete description. I went ahead and purchased and was very pleased with it! The phone came with 100% battery life, the screen was perfect, and I was overall very pleased! I highly recommend this phone and company!",

"  It was working fine battery life was more than anticipated at 96 instead of the advertised 85-90 I believe, but after about 40 days the phone would restart like it had no battery left even though it was at 100% or while it was charging. Everything else was fine and id probably still buy another phone from the company.",

"  The phone arrived ahead of schedule, but it was immediately and clearly obvious that one of the rear camera lenses was cracked in multiple places (which was helpfully covered by a gross dirt-streaked sticker). The seller's ""certified"" / ""renewed"" product label is dubious, at best. Here's to hoping that their returns process works better than the eyesight of whoever ""certifies"" their phones...",

"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2020Size: 128GBColor: PurpleService Provider: T-MobileProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  I just messaged the seller, and hoping to hear from them soon.The phone came super quick, which is amazing. I was able to figure out how to transfer my info super fast and I was happy to be saving money and causing less damage to the planet. However, the camera must be damaged as it takes pictures with a dark spot in the picture. And now the keyboard is lagging. I hope they are able to work with me to either send me another one or fix this one.",

Pros and cons,
"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2022Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  I just received this phone today for my daughter and their are no scratches and everything went smoothly with transferring her old phone to that one but 3 hours later it started glitching. I tried to turn it off but it wouldnâ€™t even do that. We tried for about 10 minutes then just gave up. When came back to it about 3 minutes later, it was fine. So I will be keeping a eye on it and let you know the updates tomorrow",

Overall a good phone and prince than receiving a new one.,
"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2020Size: 128GBColor: GreenService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  In good condition. No scratches, came with a screen protector.The only problem is that it has turned off a couple of times when I least expect it after having it less than a month, it turns right back on, but it is a major inconvenience. I had to find a repair shop near me to fix it. Since I use my phone for work, I cannot be without one. I contacted the seller and was only refunded $20 (I kept the phone for my work)I recommend that if you do get a used phone, to double-check everything before getting rid of your old one.",

The phone doesnâ€™t work it turns off every 1 to 2 minutes.,
"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2021Size: 128GBColor: RedService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
  We thought it worked cause it turned on and we transferred data. It gets hot and turns off completely during calls or texting and also when Iâ€™m not even using it I can see it turn on and off. Setup the facial recognition but since it turns off so much it always needs the manual code. Definitely requesting a return.,

"  As always, I was a bit skeptical about ordering a $800 phone off amazon but Iâ€™m so glad I did. It even came with a screen protector and it came brand new, only a tiny scratch on the screen protector but other then that the phone was spotless. So happy with what I got and happy it saved me a couple $100. The phone also came unlocked and had no trouble switching it over to my network. 10/10!",

  Everything on the outside of this phone was just okay until I switched it ON and used it for a couple hours. This cellphone couldn't stay ON for longer than 30 minutes and kept restarting/booting itself repeatedly. The operating system was stuck on the oldest version and refused to accept any updates. Complete LEMON! Avoid this seller at all costs!,

"  Â I really liked the packaging that the phone came in. Everything was wrapped, and sealed neatly. I would honestly get as much gigabytes as possible so your phone has enough space, and storage. I wasnâ€™t sure if I should buy this phone because it is amazon renewed, but they did a great job. Battery life was perfect, screen and all is functional. Make sure you have a SIM card for the phone. The value is kind of expensive but itâ€™s worth it, also the phone is fully unlocked and that is very important!. Thank you!",

"  Love the phone, brand new conditions, I didnâ€™t see any problems. Great battery life. Like I can be on 1% and still use my phone no problems. Came quickly. I bought the unlocked version and I have T-Mobile. Iâ€™ve had the phone for about a month no issues. T-Mobile was able to easily connect it with my old number. My only issue is that my google accounts keep asking me for my password. Not sure if thatâ€™s a phone issue or a gmail issue.",

First One Ordered Defective. Second One Great,
"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2022Size: 64GBColor: YellowService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",

  First one we got kept turning off. Return was painless but having to transfer data from old phone to new phone TWICE was a little inconvenient. Now satisfied.,

  I took my new phone to the phone store to have my information transferred from  my old apple 6 plus...bought a screen protector and case for it...When the clerk was putting on the screen cover he noticed some scratches on the screen.. Very disappointing... He was almost done.. I have kept the phone because of all the time and effort and added expense..  MISS not having a button on the bottom... Wish one would receive a booklet when you make a purchase like this..,

Unusable Piece of Crap,
"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2020Size: 256GBColor: GreenService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  I wouldnt pay more than $100 for this thing. They've obviously done a terrible job fixing whatever issue this phone had in the refurbishing process. The thing is so slow it crashes when scrolling through simple apps like Twitter or Instagram. Need to back up your photos? Forget it, impossible on this thing. Quite literally unusable for anything but calls. Absolute waste of money. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS SELLER.",

"Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2021Size: 128GBColor: RedService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  I was kind of skeptical at first to buy it, I know amazon itâ€™s quality, but read some experiences that went wrong and I was scared it was going to be the same for me, but I took the chance and I have 0 regrets. I got the phone in nearly mint condition, I cannot see any scratches, the battery is at 100% and the face ID works just fine. Have been with my new phone for 2 weeks and everything works perfect. I love it and I loved the price and it came with a screen protector installed and all. 100% worth my money, helping the planet and saving some money.",

Since I lost my phone and did not backup, my fault, I had to download apps and do my own email stuff.  The phone is nice with works well.  Very happy, only had it one day, but we are off to a great start!",

"  The phone came in great condition. The only dent or scratch was on the screen and itâ€™s nail thin and very hard to even spot. The battery health is 81% which is definitely on the lower end, but the battery last a good amount of time before I have to recharge the phone. I would recommend others to purchase as well.",

Genuine Apple product,
"Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2021Size: 64GBColor: GreenService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
  I had the iphone 7 that started to show signs of failure. I wanted a bigger screen and an upgraded camera but didn't want to pay the $1000 plus dollars for it. I found this phone and pulled the trigger. I'm always worried about possible issues when spending this kind of money. I'm happy to say the phone is working great after 4 months. The camera is fantastic and shots with low light is no longer a problem. I use the phone with strava so it gets good use while I'm cycling. I'll buy another iphone from this seller when the time comes.,

"  This phone was not having a great battery life as expected or reviewed others, maybe renewed compromise. Display was not that great, had some wear and tear. But features of Iphone 11 are all functional. Had to return but its almost more than 2 weeks, I have not received  the refund of it.",

It wasn't bad but it was great either,
"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2021Size: 64GBColor: PurpleService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  My biggest disappointment was the battery life. It came at 86% and by the time I downloaded the IOS 15 update it went down to 81% ðŸ‘Ž Was hard for the phone to keep charge after that. Cosmeticaly the phone didnt't have scratches or dents but it could have been cleaner, such as the ear piece and speakers. I tired to clean it but wasn't so successful. Thought the seller I choose would have been a better purchase for me as they had so much 5 stars...guess not",

  The phone works great! It was fully unlocked. I have had no trouble setting it up. I highly recommend. The price is great for the phone. It works like n new phone. The Face ID works great. There was no starches. It is is good shape. The batter life was at 86. Which is great for a used phone. The shipping was packed very well. It came with a charger & a screen protector. It also came with a thing to take your sims card out which is great.,

iPhone 11 Very Happy Purchase!!,
"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2020Size: 128GBColor: YellowService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
  Iâ€™m IN LOVE with this phone and the fact that itâ€™s like brand new and unlocked just made it better for me. Seriously it was like buying a brand spanking new iPhone for a much lower price. The camera quality is why I wanted this phone to begin with but everything else just makes the phone so great. Iâ€™m very happy!,

"  Iâ€™ve had this phone for a few days, and everything seems to work great! The battery life came at 86% But I can go with the whole day without charging it! At the end of the day the battery is usually at 45-50%. There isnâ€™t even any scratches or marks that I can notice. This package was delivered on time and it even came with a charger and a cube (not apple products but still work just the same). So glad I was able to save some money!!",

I returned it without a problem and received a full refund, which I'm very thankful for because this phone wasn't cheap and it kept powering on and off by itself which was unusual.",

"  A good product for value. I found other phones that were $30-$60 cheaper, and this phone did come with some slight cosmetic problems on the body. But overall I chose to go with this product due to 1)it coming with accessories, 2) it had the option of getting a protection warranty, and 3) it being an Amazon trusted item with the ability to return.Battery life is at 91% capacity which is good.",

GREAT butâ€¦,
"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2021Size: 64GBColor: RedService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
  I was very hesitant due to â€œitâ€™s too good to be trueâ€ old saying. But honestly it works like new with a minor set back. Siri doesnâ€™t respond to voice so me saying â€œ HEY SIRIâ€ doesnâ€™t do much. Weirdly enough it does activate randomly to loud coughs. Which is strange but this is an on off deal. I really enjoy it. Besides the Siri dearer thereâ€™s a chip of paint near the bottom lens that would frustrate someone with OCD. Overall good buy. I lucked out.,

"  The phone came in like brand new. Iâ€™ve been using it for over a month now and it works like brand new. Itâ€™s definitely worth the money, and exceeded my expectations. There were no visible or harsh scratches or damage to it when it arrived, and compared to my iPhone 6, the battery life is long. There are plenty of reasons to buy a refurbished phone; money saving and reusing is one of them. Iâ€™d say go for it if you really want to.",

  I have to be up front and say I wasnâ€™t sure about this at first. It was a lot of money to pay. Considering itâ€™s my first iPhone coming from android. I got the iPhone 11 fully unlocked in black and it was super easy to get activated. A fast charger came with it no headphones but I use truly wireless earbuds so Iâ€™m good. My final verdict is buy the phone it will be a great investment. My experience has been so great my woman wanted one so weâ€™re currently waiting for it to come in the mail.,

"  I bought this phone about a year ago, immediately i noticed that it was garbage. the screen on the phone would bug out and start making calls, pressing buttons, swiping, tapping on everything by itself. i took it to the shop and they told me the phone had already been fixed multiple times by someone else. i understand it was used, but it said â€œlike newâ€ when i bought it. i had to throw it out within weeks.",

  Itâ€™s nice and I definitely understand it was used but you literally could have said the microphone is some how clogged up and people barely hear me and it didnâ€™t even come with headphones I might return it I donâ€™t know but hey I phone 11 woo hoo..,

  The device came in an original box and was in great (like-new) condition. No scrathches at all. The charger is off-brand and charges a bit slow. Get yourself an OEM charger or something more powerful if you don't have one already.,

Great phone! As for the charger?...,
"Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2020Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Phone arrived in great shape, battery seems to hold a charge very well. I did have a problem with the supplied aftermarket charging cable, as the phone would give the â€œaccessory not supportedâ€ notification. When I swapped to another charge cable the problem stopped and the battery was able to fully charge. Although mine did not arrive in the original packaging, it was well packed in bubble wrap with a glass screen protector installed. Overall, I am satisfied with the phone, although donâ€™t count on the accessories.",

Bad sound quality,
"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2021Size: 256GBColor: GreenService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
  It has some issue with volume and when I put the speaker mode in a call the sound quality is bad . It shows signs that it was opened and screwed back in at the bottom of the phone where the speakers are. I ended up buying headphones to be able to use it. I put volume on maximum to have a disent sound. I understand that it is a renewed model but for the price i paid i was expecting a much better quality . Battery life is very good,

"  Ordered this phone on a Saturday, received it the following Saturday. Battery life at 100% and it was almost fully charged. One tiny scuff on the top edge but only noticeable because I was looking for them. No cracks. Honestly was sooo nervous about ordering it but after a couple days, I just did it. Iâ€™m so relieved it was worth it! Iâ€™m writing this review from it! Iâ€™m sorry for the others it didnâ€™t work out for but it gets my 100% approval.",

            We panicked because we were not home for a couple of days.  when we returned the parcel was not at the door .. started looking but did not find .. it turned out the neighbor realized that we were not at home and took us .. we rang the doorbell but no one was .. only a day later she showed upðŸ˜.  glue looks new.  very satisfied .. I'll check later how the phone works.,

  First off it looked like the phone was dropped on concrete and the screen was replaced it had scuffs and cuts all over. The phone itself couldnâ€™t work properly and my boyfriend got so fed up he tried to reset it to factory settings and it took forever for it to even do that. I was embarrassed to give him this for Christmas save your money and get one from Apple!!,

  iPhone came as describe and works well. Noticed some little bumps at the bottom of the screen but nothing bad and knew some minor imperfections were bound to come with the phone. Battery was at 83% capacity which is good. Just wish the phone was packaged better because it was clanging around in the box and could have caused potential damage to the phone during shipment.,

"  When I received this refurbished iPhone 11, the first thing I noticed were scratches on the back and scuffs on the sides of the phone. I didn't expect the phone to be perfect but I had hoped the previous owner would have used a case. Returned to buy it new from Apple for $499.",

  I really need a phone as I just had a galaxy S8 and bought it in 2018 and back in 2020 I decided to put my money towards this instead of a more expensive brand new iPhone and Iâ€™m glad I did! It did come with a very faint scratch on the screen which isnâ€™t noticeable unless you really focus but after putting a screen protector on it isnâ€™t even visible anymore.,

  I started having problems with this phone about a week ago with the fingerprint reader and when someone calls me the button wonâ€™t slide over so I can answer the phone. The touch pad has been messing up as well. I havenâ€™t even had this phone a good two months. I donâ€™t have any water damage or an other damage so not sure why it is acting up.,

"  When peeling the phone film off, there were shards of glass coming from somewhere on the phone. There was also an almost intentional cursive H dead smack in the middle of the screen. No iphone certified accessories were included, only 3rd party.Its the same price, new, from the Apple store. Just do that.",

DO NOT BUY,

"  Terrible item. Had to take it to the apple store to even activate. Stated it has ""unauthorized equipment"" but Apple got it working. Phone randomly starts shutting down. Then, at the first update it shuts down & won't connect to charger, computer, anything! TERRIBLE TERRIBLE PRODUCT! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY",

The microphone had a siren noise after 1 1/2,
"Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2020Size: 64GBColor: GreenService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
  I like the phone but almost at the 2 week point the volume had problems and couldnâ€™t get a good response from the people said they didnâ€™t recognize the IMEI number it was invalid?? So Iâ€™m looking at having to get it fixed after paying almost 700.00 for the phone. Iâ€™ll never purchase anything from them again so disappointed.,

Great quality,
"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2021Size: 64GBColor: PurpleService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
  I recently made the switch from the Samsung Galaxy S10 to the IPhone 11 and the phone arrived fast looking practically brand new. No scratches or blemishes. Maximum battery capacity is 85% but this phone holds a charge pretty good. I've had the phone for a month now with no issues. This is my 2nd purchase from this seller and I will buy again in the future.,

Amazing buy!,
"Reviewed in the United States on April 16, 2021Size: 64GBColor: PurpleService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  I absolutely love this! It connected to my carrier right away and it had no dings or cracks or anything. I was definitely skeptical about buying an â€œunlockedâ€ phone online but Iâ€™m glad I did. The battery life is at 88% which is still good and itâ€™s nothing to get a new battery when it comes time for that. But otherwise, Iâ€™m super happy with the phone.",

iPhone Speaker,
"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2021Size: 128GBColor: WhiteService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
  I bought this iPhone in October 2019 and the speaker is already giving issues. Even if something was wrong with the phone before and it was fixed it shouldnâ€™t have started giving problems so quickly. The return date has already passed so thereâ€™s nothing I can do or I would just send it back but I spent a lot of money on the item so I need something to be done please.,

  The phone seemed  great! But the battery just wouldnâ€™t stay charged and took a long time to get charged. We took it in to replace the battery and they encouraged us to trade phones. But Amazon was fabulous to work with and we would definitely buy a phone from them again in the future.,

  I purchased this phone as a Christmas gift. It was â€œtestedâ€ and supposedly â€œlike new and fully functional.â€ The screen is badly scratched. Face ID does not work. The back glass is badly scratched. There is no time for a return and refund. I am being offered a $20 refund.  ?!?!?!?  What a rip-off!!!,

"  Itâ€™s been a few days and itâ€™s working perfectly fine. Only flaws is that it didnâ€™t come in a nice box and the charging brick plus the wires was off brand. Overall 4/5. It would be a good phone for older people in my opinion, not too good neither too bad, just right for them.",

Honest review,
"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2020Size: 128GBColor: RedService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
  Honestly when it came in I was very happy but unfortunately some letter didnâ€™t work on the keyboard and I pressed on the letter and wouldnâ€™t go through so honestly I paid 700$ and the phone looked very good but the screen wasnâ€™t good. Iâ€™m sorry but sorry but I know you can do better next time. But I still recommend getting it because most phones do come in at its best.,

Hardware bad software good,

  Listen hardware wise itâ€™s okay. Some missing chips in paint and a lot of little scratches from an angle hopefully it doesnâ€™t cause too much trouble when the screen protector comes in(will update later). Software I donâ€™t see any problems so far but will edit if there comes an issue!,

  I love everything about this product and Iâ€™m not just saying that like Iâ€™m an apple fanboy itâ€™s a really good phone great features and so on siri annoys me cause she chimes in for no reason but thatâ€™s always a thing over all it was well worth it .,

  Phone arrived glass looked as if change had rubbed against it and scratched. Rubber around phone looked like it was chewed by a small rodent. Easy return and no hassle on that aspect. For a few more bucks get a refurb direct from Apple.,

  I personally didnâ€™t have any issues when ordering this. Itâ€™s a great phone and Iâ€™m very happy with it. I have ordered phone from Amazon in the past and lucked out with them working properly. Ether Amazon is getting the better phones or I just got lucky with this one. I would recommend,

  Man this is great! Got this a couple months ago for me and and my girlfriend and they work great! Only problem was the chip for a boost mobile phone but you just have to ask for a new one and they will give it to you! Everything works fine and I recommend this! 10/10,

  Was a really good unlocked phone one thing I ask is if possible to tell which carrier these renewed phones were last on because I did a run around and found out these are gsm phones (tmobile was my carrier) but it turned out great! Brand new phone and not even a scratch. They were nice enough to even put a screen protector on it,

  Phone came in good condition except it wouldnâ€™t make phone calls or text messages unless updated. The â€œupdateâ€ wouldnâ€™t allow the phone to update as well as not reading the SIM card. Upon further investigation it meant that the phone was unlocked but not the phone carrier. I returned it and I am still waiting on my refund.,

  Phone broke 4 months after I ordered due to a â€œhardwareâ€ issue Iâ€™m pretty sure the phone broke from this before and had to be renewed and was never truly fixed this is a faulty phone and I would not order it,

  The phone works great but they failed to mention that it wonâ€™t work with all phone companies. Fully renewed and restored they should put which companies you can use as a plan and which ones you canâ€™t but they donâ€™t.VERY misleading product.,

"It catches up to Android, finally.",
"Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2020Size: 128GBColor: RedService Provider: T-MobileProduct grade: Renewed",
,
"  I bought mine from Metro, so my only choices were black or red, went with black though it sits in a case anyway. Stuck with 64GB, but I don't use too many apps nor plan to keep photos/videos stored on it.As someone who has been on Android since the start of smartphones, this is THE time where jumping to iOS is going to be the most smooth, and you'll enjoy a few extra features. This won't happen until iOS 14, but once it's released, it will make this phone a great choice even for users used to Android.The phone, like many other phones, is a little too smooth for holding, which makes pressing buttons by accident a thing, so slap on a case not only to protect it, but to make handling better. One upcoming feature in iOS 14 is the ability to tap the back of the phone for your chosen options, so it's yet to be known if protective cases will get in the way of that functionality. I don't use headphones much, but it is still annoying knowing these phones no longer have an analogue 3.5mm audio jack. The packaging is top notch tho, and I've been using the screen protector it shipped with, even though I don't think it's meant to stay on the phone lol, but if it gets bubbles or just gets too damaged, I'll just replace it. It still ships with a ton of apps you may or may not use. I don't use a few of them and a couple cannot be deleted. iOS 14 will allow us to hide them tho, so this will soon be a thing of the past. Getting used to navigating the system doesn't take too long, even to an Android user. Eventually things just flow.I picked this phone because it's as good as the 11 pro/pro max, but without the telephoto lens, and still bigger than the 11 pro. I felt it was a reasonable compromise since I will rarely need the optical zoom capabilities of the pro max. The wide lens is something I will use far more since it comes in handy when you want to take pictures of a room and sometimes you simply have no space to move far back enough. That's the rear cameras, but the front camera can also do .5 wide, which is good for vloggers/irl streamers, especially if you ever need to include another person in the shot.Setup is ez pz and now you can import your stuff not only if you are upgrading from another iPhone, but you can also import stuff from Android, you only need to download an app to the Android phone for it to work.I haven't used all the features of the phone yet, but it looks like it's going to be a good experience, at least until Apple decides to slow it down to coerce me to upgrade lol.",

"So far, so good Great Iphone 11!",
"Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2022Size: 128GBColor: GreenService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: Renewed",
,
"  I have been using a hand me down Iphone 6s plus for years. It was a phone my sister no longer needed to I upgraded from the iphone 4. I haven't felt the need to upgrade since newer iphones basically do the same thing except for the facial thing blah blah. I don't need all that and I actually prefer a phone that has the wired jack plug. Why in the world did Apple ever do away with that?!Anyways, I realized I needed a new phone with the Iphone 6s plus started taking really crappy photos and was just slower overall even after I changed out the battery. So I started looking for newer phones and a friend recommended Amazon and that a renewed phone wasn't a bad way to go. The Iphone 11 purple 128 gb was a great deal considering brand new phones go for well over 1100-1300. I had some issues setting up the new iphone (my fault with forgetting my encryption passcode) but I was finally able to get the new iphone updated, transferred over my data, inserted the Sim card, and it works great with Mint Mobile. No issues so far with Mint that I have seen yet. The back and front did have a few slight smudges however it was nothing a tempered glass screen couldn't cover up and honestly I don't notice them at all when I am using the phone. It is in great condition but the battery is at 85% so I'm thinking in the next 6 months to 1 year I will need to replace the battery.Overall, this has been a great experience. I love the new phone and will update my review in 90 days.",

Amazing But some complains,

"  This iPhone is a really good phone, probably one of the best phones (at the time). It has a few problems but it is a solid iPhone.Camera: This phone takes really good pictures. It has live photos you can blur out your backgrounds and even up the camera to 4k. It has a nighttime mode where you can change your picture to look like it was taken during the day. It is a cool thing but the zoom in the future is not that good, it comes out blurry.Battery; The battery life on the phone was amazing after about 1 week of having it die faster. When you are using specific apps it dies quickly. You can go from 100 to 70 in just 10 mins. Also, it tends to burn up when you are using apps.Price: The iPhone 11 stands at about $409 and $521 Canadian. Before the price was a lot higher but with a price like this it is a must-get for anyone looking for a decent Phone.I compared the iPhone 11 to the iPhone 10. The build is the same, it looks the same other than the camera. The iPhone X takes a point for battery life. The iPhone 11 dies faster than the iPhone X. the iPhone 11 has a much better camera than the X because it has 1.71x more megapixels which make the camera a lot better. And if you are a person that likes to play games the iPhone 11 has a higher resolution, a fast download time and the CPU is great. So the iPhone 11 is Better than the iPhone X.The iPhone 11 is the same as the XR. It has one less camera than Apple's more-premium models, and its screen isn't nearly as nice. There are advantages to the Pros, but after getting a for what the iPhone 11 is capable of, spending the extra $300 is not a bad thing, it is really good and worth it.",

Disappointment,
"Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2020Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: Renewed",
,
"  I purchased two iPhone 11s (New). I have always been an Android user. I purchased the iPhone for its enhanced security. Here are the issues: The glass screen often does not respond so I find myself pressing an arrow or icon several times to get it to work. Whenever I use the phone for a WiFi hotspot, it will disconnect from whatever device I am connecting to after a few minutes. Also, the iPhone is not as user-friendly as an Android. If I could return my iPhones I would do it in a minute.",

RIP OFF!!!!,
"Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2020Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: Renewed",
,
"  The phone had so many dents not even scratcheS DENTS!!!! I paid$587.00, which is $12.00 less than apple sellig it for $599, I had no idea it was so cheap on apple, else I would have bought it from there. I am so disappointed with how bad the phone looks on the outside. So far software is good but other than that it looks like an old phone.  I would be happy paying $250.00 for a phone that looks like this not almost $600.00",

No Plug to CHARGE IT!,
"Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2021Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: Renewed",
,
  I am FURIOUS!! I bought this and NO WAY TO CHARGE IT!! They don't bother adding in of plug so that you can actually charge the phone! Their excuse to save on admissions? Really? Now I have to go and order one before I can use my phone that I just spent $600 on! They don't even provide you a way to plug it in and charge it! It's all a scam so that you are forced to spend more money to charge it once you get it! And I think that sucks it's a scam to rip off their customers if you want to buy a phone don't buy one that doesn't come with a plug. SCAM!,

"  I had gotten the phone really early, it has no scratches or blemishes and the battery life is 90%. The box and charger wasnâ€™t apple (but if you have your own before this shouldnâ€™t be too bad) and it did have the phones information with it. It IS unlocked and came with a screen protector and sim card remover :) everything is nice and like new. I canâ€™t say this is guaranteed to be for everyone but if you need something not super pricey this is the best seller, be aware not every phone can be perfect but if you want this buy it with some thought.",

"  I got an iPhone 11 a year ago. Over the course of that year, itâ€™s had countless issues. The display is discolored, the back is cracked, wireless charging isnâ€™t functional, the flashlight doesnâ€™t work, the battery dies at 70%, and the Face ID is tedious, and doesnâ€™t work at times. TLDR: Avoid the iPhone 11.",

I'll have to admit...,
"Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2020Size: 256GBColor: RedService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  I Love it! At first, I was very skeptical and prepared myself to send it back expecting to be disappointed. When I got the package the box said it was sanitized and the smell co-signed that 100%. The phone had no scratches on the body and was virtually perfect, only scratch found was a somewhat length scuff on the vertical half portion of the upper screen which seems to be fixable if some sort of adhesive was applied. With a screen protector, the scratch isn't even noticeable and the battery health was 100%. Got a 256GB for the price of the 128, I'm satisfied for now. I'll report any defects in the future but so far I definitely recommend this.",

Loving it so far!,
"Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2020Size: 128GBColor: PurpleService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  In the 10 years that Iâ€™ve owned smartphones I have always had androids. I had a galaxy S9 but I accidentally cracked the screen, so I decided to get the S10 on a whim. I immediately hated it. Iâ€™ve been just tolerating it for 9 months, and was prepared to just tolerate it for the full 2 years. But then I found this deal on a refurb iPhone 11!Like everyone else I was a little skeptical over it being a refurb but it came in excellent condition! The only cosmetic damage is a very small scratch on the screen which is invisible unless youâ€™re really inspecting the screen.The battery life on this phone so far has been pretty amazing. I use my phone a lot at home and especially for work, the battery lasted almost 2 full days???? Not sure if thatâ€™s because itâ€™s so new but either way Iâ€™m happy.Having never owned an iPhone before I was nervous that I would absolutely hate the ui but I got used to it pretty quickly! I actually really really like this phone! The display is a much better resolution than the S10 even though the screen size is exactly the same. The audio seems to be much clearer as well.I also really love the unique color! The pictures of it really donâ€™t do it justice. In the listing it looks like a light grayish lavender but in person itâ€™s more saturated. Iâ€™ve only had it for 4 days and itâ€™s already gotten lots of compliments!Overall I really really like this phone so far and I really have no complaints. I probably wonâ€™t be going back to Android :)",

Make your own choice,
"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2021Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
  I order this and found out my batter percentage was 86%. I thought they tested for faults and repaired them. Overall the phone is good and in very good condition. But if you are buying this as renewed from amazon make sure to check the price in apple's website bcuz apple is selling it for more $50 for a new one and if you have a old iphone like 6s which i did you could get it by replace for less than $560.,

            I order this and found out my batter percentage was 86%. I thought they tested for faults and repaired them. Overall the phone is good and in very good condition. But if you are buying this as renewed from amazon make sure to check the price in apple's website bcuz apple is selling it for more $50 for a new one and if you have a old iphone like 6s which i did you could get it by replace for less than $560.,

"A roll of the dice, just go through Apple",
"Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2021Size: 256GBColor: WhiteService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  So I ordered 3 of these refurbished phones in total. The first phone, the screen shattered the first time it fell 2 feet to the floor which indicates the screen must have been replaced with one of the cheap ones. I returned it and ordered a second one. This time they sent the wrong color and the screen was visibly scratched pretty badly. I didn't even bother turning it on and just sent it back right away. The 3rd one I got had a big purple patch on the LCD screen like something heavy had fell on it. I sent that one back too. I went to the Apple website and you can get Apple Certified Refurbished phones for the exact same price as the ones here! but they're actually inspected and verified by Apple. SO I ended up doing that instead. If I could do it all over again I'd do that from the beginning and save myself the headache. It's a roll of the dice with these phones.",

GREAT Phone At GREAT Price,

"  I canâ€™t believe how great of a deal that Iâ€™ve gotten with this phone. I know it says refurbished, but I donâ€™t see any blemishes or anything wrong with it. It has a lot to do with the Company that Iâ€™ve dealt with,The companies name is (buy spry) and they were great in sending me an excellent phone and in great condition. I would highly recommend this company if youâ€™re looking for a less expensive phone but just as good as all the other ones that are out there. Iâ€™m very satisfied with this purchase from this company. I bought this iPhone 11 with my own money, nobodyâ€™s paying me to write this review. Again I would recommend this phone just Because the company standâ€™s by their word and will send you a great phone at a reasonable price.One last comment about this phone I included a photo of the battery life, itâ€™s 95%. Thatâ€™s great in my book.",

Definitely worth it!!!,
"Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2020Size: 64GBColor: YellowService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  I purchased the yellow iPhone 11 64gb unlocked and overall it is a pretty great phone. Even though the reviews were iffy, I still decided to take that chance. Once I got the phone it came with a screen protector which was a pretty good bonus. It also came with a charger and adapter (not from apple but works just as good). I did notice a few things that were definitely wrong. My ringer button does not work at all. It is a very tiny green dot in the left corner which isnâ€™t noticeable at all and it honestly took me a few days to even notice it. It did disappoint me that Iâ€™m not able to purchase apple care for this phone but that is ok because my phone company offers a better deal (T-Mobile). I am coming from a iPhone 6s so this is a huge upgrade and it was definitely worth it so overall it is a pretty good deal for the price so if youâ€™re thinking about making that purchase then go right ahead.",

"  Iâ€™m so thankful Amazon offers the phone refurbished. Iâ€™m not spending $150 a month with leases and payments to these phone companies. With a family of seven and kids that want to keep up with the Joneses. Verizon offers a prepaid plan unlimited everything for $35. Thatâ€™s right for $35 a month draft it out of your debit card or go in the store and pay. If you have your own phone you get the same service as I paid $150 a month for for $35. I cannot do that if Amazon did not offer these refurbished phones. Thanks to Amazon and thanks to whoever is refurbishing these phones. Please take my advice,Switch to prepaid and buy yourself a pair of shoes every month with the savings",

,
"  I have always used an android phone. I find that the assumption that people should automatically know how to use an iphone is ignorant. I have struggled to learn how to use this phone right down to how to turn it on and off. I purchase it so that I would be able to do face time with my granddaughter. My sons have iphones. They don't live nearby, so they can't show me how to use them.  A little help goes a long way. I also find that the phone doesn't hold a charge for a decent amount of time.",

  Checks all of the boxes. We all know what weâ€™re getting into buying a renewed phone but I was very surprised with this one. Battery is at 100% even comes with a tempered glass installed perfectly. There was only one small little scratch but itâ€™s very unnoticeable and the case hides it anyway. I was apprehensive but Iâ€™m very happy with what I got. Plus with Apple no longer giving charging bricks out the box might as well buy this.,

"Yes, you should.",
"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2021Size: 64GBColor: RedService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Iâ€™ve had the phone for a month now and when I got it came in a white box, with no original charger box just a white cable and black generic box. After the plastic was remove the phone showed very little to no damage at all, very small scratches around the corners of the screen from past use but you can barely notice it with a screen protector and a phone case on it. The battery life was 87% when I got it but now it has gone up to 91%, but the battery is amazing and lasts all day. It is fast and reliable. Value for your money, yes. Fave recognition also is fast, the camera is great too, overall great buy",

Microphone for phone calls did not work,
"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2020Size: 256GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  The camera comes with three microphones (selfie camera, front camera, and phone talk camera) and the microphone for regular cell phone calls , located  next to the power input, had scratchy noise and people could barely hear me even since I received it. I did not have a phone  protection cover. I had to call Apple and after troubleshooting, they wanted $400 to repair. So I returned to the seller as it is obvious that they had not done their quality check.The only good thing is that I received my money refund fast, within 4 days of shipping the return.",

"This is my first failure Amazon renew shopping, the phone creen died in two weeks",
"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2021Size: 128GBColor: RedService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  The screen died two weeks after I bought it, totally died. They said I have to send to phone back and wait for several days, and they can send me a new one. But I have many data stored in this phone which I cannot just give them up and live without a working phone for a week. I repair it on my own packet and they refused to give any reimbursement or makeup. Disappointed, the screen change cost 130 dollar.",

Amazon Iphone 11,
"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2021Size: 128GBColor: PurpleService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Whenever I first purchase this phone it was because my dogs decided to chew up my iPhone X I had for 3 years. Everywhere I looked the iPhone 11 was $800-$1,000. I was very skeptical about buying a used iPhone off of amazon and whenever i unpackaged the phone the ""Smart Phone"" box it came in was all bent and opened at the top but surprisingly and thankfully the iPhone was perfectly fine, came with a full battery, no cracks or dinged places. And the transfer over with just my old sim card was so easy and hassle free. I am in love with my new phone, definitely with all my money!!",

Quite Impressed!,
"Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2021Size: 64GBColor: GreenService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  I was apprehensive about purchasing a telephone online as Iâ€™m more of a tangible person. With that being said I did, however, order a refurbished phone from Amazon. This turned out to be one of the best purchases Iâ€™ve ever made. The phone arrived with not a scratch on it; looks brand new.  After putting in my original Sim card from my 2013 phone, everything just started rolling and no problems were encountered. Highly recommend purchasing this phone!",

The thickness of the phone is amazing and feels good on hands, and the sheerness of the phone is like itâ€™s brand new! Thank you for the glass protector that came installed with the phone! I will be purchasing other phones from them in the future!",

"  I rarely buy brand new Apple. I have always bought refurbished iPhones and theyâ€™ve all been great. This one from Amazon is no exception. It came in a generic box with a generic charger but the phone itself is great. Everything works well, looks beautiful. No scratches on the screen but a few on the back (as stated in the quality assurance). Cameras are great and so is every other feature. If youâ€™re looking to buy a great refurbed iPhone for a good cost, this company does great!",

"  This is not a spam, iPhone came like new and even with a screen protector however it is a little cheap (the screen protector) and also came with a white thick charger. Didnâ€™t come in the iPhone box but itâ€™s okay it didnâ€™t bother me much. It was fully unlocked and like new like I said. I bought mine about 3 weeks ago and I love it. Also great camera. Battery life is pretty long about 8 hours if your mostly on your phone but charges pretty fast.",

  Â I was skeptical at first because of the bad reviews but I decided to try it out anyways. It got here today and so far has worked fine! It looks brand new and the battery health is at 99%. The screen responds to my touch just fine and there were no problems connecting my Apple ID. It hasnâ€™t restarted or shut off randomly at all. Thereâ€™s still opportunity for it to do something strange but right now Iâ€™m very happy with it! :),

,
  At first I was  happy because the phone came with screen protector. How sweet! Then I notice thereâ€™s some bobbles under it so I tried to fix it. Then I found another surprise. The phone was scratched all over but with the screen protector it wonâ€™t showed. I was not happy about it.  Returned it right the way.,

"  This is the best experience Iâ€™ve had with a renewed phone, it comes in anothee box and another charger (I was expecting to buy the fast charge anyways) it comes with a 96% of battery health and just ONE scratch on the back but it is really small, it comes unlocked (or at least you can use it with metro by t-mobile) definitely recommend!

  I got this phone so quick I needed a quick replacement I was very skeptical of buying a phone from Amazon and it is way cheaper than the ones at other stores and it works great Iâ€™ve had mine for two months now it works amazing and it also comes with a apple charger which works amazing as well and I will never buy a phone at retail price again especially since it came a whole week earlier.,

"  Although the battery health is 89% I am over all satisfied with the phone. It looks new, no visible wear on the surface. The product works almost as if it is new as well. Even with the lower battery health level the phone was definitely worth every penny. The seller also overnighted the phone at no extra charge which was really amazing.",

Great purchase!! Fully unlocked and looks like a brand new phone,
"Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2021Size: 64GBColor: PurpleService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: Renewed",
,
  I was so scared about buying a phone on Amazon renewed but so far I love it!! No visual damage and no issues as far as being locked or anything Iâ€™m very satisfied with this phone so far so good!!  Definitely will be buying from them again. It came with a screen protector on it already so thatâ€™s was a plus also. I ordered my phone on Tuesday and received on Saturday so not to long of a wait.. I upgraded from a 7plus it was well needed!!,

"  Exactly what I needed ! When I originally received the order, it did not come in the original Apple packaging, the box was crushed in one corner, and the package was extremely hot. I was scared since I have not had good experiences buying electronics second hand before. Despite the crushed box, the phone was safe with protective wrapping, and the distributor even added a screen protector for me ! I bought some glass protectors to add but now I donâ€™t have to immediately open that package because the seller has kindly given me one. The charger and plug work good, I use my old Apple charger and have the one that came with this phone saved for travel. It has been a month since Iâ€™ve had this phone, and the condition is great. the camera quality is much better than my old 7 plus, and the battery life is also MUCH better. The color is very beautiful as well! I do sometimes find my phone glitching, but that may be because I run many applications at once and overwork the phone. All in all, this was a good purchase, although it was quite pricey.",

"  The product allows you to do and create so many things such as; Texting, calling, using social media, you can even create art and edit photos that youâ€™ve taken with its Dual 12MP Wide and Ultra Wide cameras and so much more. This product is The iphone 11, created by Apple. Apple also makes other electronics such as tablets, bluetooth earphones, smart watches, computers, streaming devices and even accessories to go with these devices. I have had this product for about two years now, and it's still working perfectly fine. This product looks like the iPhone XR but with two caramers.  Itâ€™s all red, with the word â€œ(Product) REDâ€ on it. It is 128GB with a 6.1 inch screen size. This is one of the best iPhones Apple has created.You might ask how this product works, and how could you use it? The product is a phone so you can call out on it. You can FaceTime other iPhone users, you can also browse through the web, you can take pictures one, and you can text people. This product is very easy to use and if you donâ€™t know how to use it they come with a â€œHOW TOâ€ so you can get a good understanding of your phone. I have used this product to the max. I have done everything with this phone. For example, I have played games on it, called people, and texted them. I have also sent emails, plus I have done my school work with it.What are some pros and cons of this iPhone? Well some pros would have to be how good the phone looks. This iPhone was  one of the first phones to have two camera. This phone has one of the faster smartphone chips in it. Which means the phone moves faster and loads up thighs a lot faster. Some more pros are that it has very good video, and screen quality. The iPhone also comes in more new colors then any other phone.The cons are lower than you think. One of them is that it didnâ€™t come with the new fast charger unlike the 11 pro max and up. This phone didnâ€™t come with an ultra wide lens, which means that any phone thatâ€™s newer than this phone has a better camera. Some more are that it didnâ€™t have any updates to the screen, so itâ€™s still the same as the iPhone XR. And, lastly the phone only comes with 64 to 256GB, so there's less storage on the phone.In conclusion you see that this is a great phone to purchase. The two years of experience I have is letting you know what Iâ€™m talking about. The pros and cons help you understand the phone some more, and it could help you towards your final purchase.",

The facial recognition feature is great for him when heâ€™s busy doing projects and cannot use his hands for the fingerprint reader.The battery life is very good, and Iâ€™m very impressed with how long the battery lasts especially for an iPhone.Also, the camera is very good and able to take very nice shots.This phone was for my husband, and I definitely want to look at getting one for myself too, now.",

Good as new,
"Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2021Size: 64GBColor: GreenService Provider: VerizonProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  So far so good. I bought this for my 16 year old son and it arrived within a week. It's a very nice phone. It came in really good shape couldn't tell it was renewed other than the damaged box and the charger it came with didn't charge it more than a couple percent in the 30 minutes it was plugged in. It arrived with a completely empty battery which was a bummer but my son charged it to 56 percent, did an update, uploaded his apps, and transferred all his data and after 2 hours the battery was only down 4 percent. He was really happy with it. And he said the camera was great. Him and his brother were having so much fun playing with the features. This is the second renewed apple product I've purchased and I recommend buying Amazon renewed to a lot of my friends. The great customer service and 90 day guarantee are really comforting. The phone had no signs of wear at all.",

Muy bueno,
"Reviewed in Mexico on October 27, 2020Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Hola! Para los que estan pensando en comprar este producto, lo recomiendo bastante, la pantalla frontal y el vidrio de atrÃ¡s intactos, viene con un vidrio protector cual tambiÃ©n evita que se vean los defectos que pueda traer pero igual es algo que le tienes que poner que evitar que se rompa con las caÃ­das, la baterÃ­a me vino con 100% de capacidad y el FaceID funciona sin problemas, cuÃ¡les eran mis mayores preocupaciones, de la estÃ©tica yo le doy 9.5/10, tiene tres pequeÃ±os rayones como de caÃ­da en la parte de abajo, para mi no son problema y no se notan mucho sobre todo por que es negro, igual la funda que le compre los cubren, estoy muy contenta con el producto, relaciÃ³n calidad precio bastante buena, te ahorras bastante a comparaciÃ³n del precio en tienda o a mesesViene en un empaque/caja pequeÃ±o protegido de bolsas de aire que amortiguan, para mi debiÃ³ estar mÃ¡s protegido porque las paqueterÃ­as suelen aventar los paquetes, pero llego bien",

"            Hola! Para los que estan pensando en comprar este producto, lo recomiendo bastante, la pantalla frontal y el vidrio de atrÃ¡s intactos, viene con un vidrio protector cual tambiÃ©n evita que se vean los defectos que pueda traer pero igual es algo que le tienes que poner que evitar que se rompa con las caÃ­das, la baterÃ­a me vino con 100% de capacidad y el FaceID funciona sin problemas, cuÃ¡les eran mis mayores preocupaciones, de la estÃ©tica yo le doy 9.5/10, tiene tres pequeÃ±os rayones como de caÃ­da en la parte de abajo, para mi no son problema y no se notan mucho sobre todo por que es negro, igual la funda que le compre los cubren, estoy muy contenta con el producto, relaciÃ³n calidad precio bastante buena, te ahorras bastante a comparaciÃ³n del precio en tienda o a mesesViene en un empaque/caja pequeÃ±o protegido de bolsas de aire que amortiguan, para mi debiÃ³ estar mÃ¡s protegido porque las paqueterÃ­as suelen aventar los paquetes, pero llego bien",

"  Estoy muy decepcionado con esta compra ya que el telÃ©fono estÃ¡ muy maltratado y con unos rayones bastante visibles y sucio tambiÃ©n. Para la calidad el precio es elevado, el modelo tambiÃ©n es el que se vende en USA por lo que no es compatible con algunas compaÃ±Ã­as en Mexico. Ya lo regrese. Espero mi reembolso pronto.",

Read before buying if you don't live in U.S,
"Reviewed in Canada on June 25, 2021Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  If you're purchasing this from outside the U.S, the ""final price"" at purchase isn't the final price because the taxes and shipping fee hasn't been applied yet (it will do so once shipped, and then you'll see the charges in your bank account). This is not the company's fault, and it is something Amazon should make clear to their customers. At first I was upset at the seller due to my misunderstanding, but after communicating with them, they did their best to make sure I wasn't dissatisfied with the transaction. Before leaving a negative review, message the seller and I'm sure they'll try to help you out, especially if you're unsure about some of the details in their advertisement.The seller delivers on promise on what the phone comes with (although a nitpick, the battery was not near 80 percent). The screen has a noticeable scratch, which was to be expected. The delivery was quick and came next day. Mine came with freebies such as a screen protector and phone case. This product is worth the money, in my opinion.",

"Reviewed in Mexico on September 29, 2020Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Al ser un producto reparado o reacondicionado, tiene uno que otro defecto. En mi caso no hay detalles a menos que se revise a consciencia. El dispositivo funciona muy bien. No se si todos los dispositivos que envÃ­an tengan protecciÃ³n de pantalla. Le da un poco de plus ese detalle. Aunque  a la luz del sol opaca la pantalla. Otra cosa que debes tener en cuenta. Es que viene sin accesorios. De antemano debes comprar al menos un cable de datos y un cargador. Un detalle a considerar en mi caso es que se pierde la conexiÃ³n con la computadora. Aun no se si es problema de hardware o software.",

"  El iphone llegÃ³ pronto y en excelentes condiciones, el problema fue al momento de usarlo, llevo 3 veces que se apaga sin razÃ³n, la pantalla se queda negra y no inicia despuÃ©s del reinicio forzoso. Inicia solo despuÃ©s de unas horas.",

"Es RECONSTRUIDO, no reacondicinado",
"Reviewed in Mexico on January 4, 2021Size: 64GBColor: GreenService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  A diferencia de la publicaciÃ³n que dice que es reacondicionado el celular es RECONSTRUIDO, la gran diferencia es que los componentes con los que reconstruyeron el iPhone no son originales (baterÃ­a, pantalla, lentes de cÃ¡mara) por que aunque el software del iPhone indique que tiene un 90% de vida Ãºtil solo dura unas 4-6 horas.",

Por esta razÃ³n realicÃ© el proceso de devoluciÃ³n.Hay equipos que parecen nuevos a pesar de ser renewed y no presentan ninguna falla, para mi mala suerte no fue asÃ­.",

Presentation Is In Desperate Need Of Value,
"Reviewed in Canada on July 16, 2021Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  For 700.00, I expected the presentation to be more than a cheap dollar store box and the phone inside one layer of bubble wrap. It didnâ€™t even have paper padding in the Amazon box to cushion the flopping around during delivery. And itâ€™s a gift!! I bought one here 3 years ago and it arrived in an IPhone box and had protective coating on the phone like new. It was a great experience and great phone. This thing looks like it was tossed in bubble wrap with a sticker on the back. I could have done better on Kijiji. Iâ€™m returning it.",

Excelente estado de conservaciÃ³n,

,
"  Tenia mucha curiosidad respecto a los telÃ©fonos Apple, siempre habÃ­a pensado en adquirir uno pero me quedaba la duda, sobre todo por el precio. Me decidÃ­ por adquirir un equipo reacondicionado para que no resultara un gran desembolso. Vaya sorpresa que me llevÃ© al ver un celular impecable!!! cero rayones, cero golpes, o algÃºn daÃ±o visible en pantalla, se ve como nuevo. El Ãºnico detalle -si es que cuenta como tal- es que el estado de la baterÃ­a marca 95% segÃºn veo las reseÃ±as eso ya es secundario, ademÃ¡s de que todas las especificaciones y software funcionan al 100%. QuizÃ¡ corrÃ­ con suerte, estoy muy satisfecho con mi compra.",

Me tocÃ³ la Mala,
"Reviewed in Mexico on February 16, 2022Size: 64GBColor: PurpleService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Lo comprÃ© en febrero del 2021 y estaba muy contenta, no tenÃ­a rayones ni golpes, todo bien y como 5,000 pesos mÃ¡s baratos que el nuevo. Lo primero que NotÃ© es que la baterÃ­a no le duraba tanto, pero es algo con lo que tenia que lidiar, porLo que me habÃ­a ahorrado, en Abril del 2021 me lleve el susto de mi vida! De un rato a otro se le desactivÃ³ el wifi y jamÃ¡s volviÃ³ a encender! La garantÃ­a es de 30 dÃ­as y ya habÃ­an pasado 2 meses! Me sentÃ­a sÃºper mal pues ya no tiene arreglo, en la tienda me cobraban 8 mil por repararlo :( y en otros locales como 3 mil pero no daban garantÃ­a que quedara, ya que es una pieza muy sensible! Trate de comunicarme con Amazon pero no es posible, luego recordÃ© que el producto es Reacondicionaso en EUA, entonces los gringos siempre dan garantÃ­a de sus productos y son amables y atentos con el cliente, me comuniquÃ© con ellos a travÃ©s de inbox (fb) y me facilitaron todo, envÃ­e de nuevo el telÃ©fono pues ellos tenÃ­an que corroborar que no se me haya caÃ­do o golpeado (cosa que no me habÃ­a pasado) lo valoraron y me regresaron todo el dinero completo! Pero lleve el susto de mi vida por quÃ© pensÃ© que no iba a recuperar mi dinero :( al final comprÃ© uno nuevo pero ya en una tienda al precio normal. Dudo que vuelva a comprar un artÃ­culo de esta magnitud reacondicionado, no vale laPena!",

Muy buena compra!! Me encantÃ³.,

"  TenÃ­a mis dudas de comprarlo. Pero me sorprendiÃ³ el estado del iphone 11. Un leve, muy leve detalle en la parte donde se inserta el cable para cargar. Vida de baterÃ­a 100%, impecable del resto del telÃ©fono. ParecÃ­a prÃ¡cticamente nuevo de tienda.4 dÃ­as despuÃ©s de recibirlo, funciona perfectamente. Solo el ID Face, como que a veces le cuesta detectar, serÃ¡ cosa de recalibrarlo y probar.Incluye ya pegado un cristal protector para la pantalla muuy Ãºtil.Sin duda volverÃ­a a comprar a este vendedor ya que tambiÃ©n llegÃ³ antes de lo esperado.Muuy satisfecho.",

PadrÃ­simo y prÃ¡cticamente nuevo,
"Reviewed in Mexico on August 1, 2021Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Creo que comprarÃ© mÃ¡s seguido Renewed jeje, mi Iphone me toco con 100% de baterÃ­a pese a que lo actualice para que se corrigiera el gap que provocaba lecturas errÃ³neas en la baterÃ­a, solo venia con una rayoncito tan pequeÃ±o que solo muy de cerca se nota, el resto del equipÃ³ super cuidado, eso sÃ­ sigue siendo un Iphone, la cÃ¡mara es excelente y la razÃ³n por la cuÃ¡l elegÃ­ el 11 y no el 12, pero como siempre la baterÃ­a no rinde como me rendÃ­a mi otro cel. Ojo, al ser de re-uso no podrÃ¡s contratar el Apple Care+, Recomiendo Renewed anÃ­mense, total, sale mal les hacen cambio o regresan su dinero, Â¿QuÃ© podrÃ­an perder?",

No sÃ© cÃ³mo funciona la certificaciÃ³n, entonces es probable que solo me estÃ© dejando llevar por la apariencia. Es USB A a lightning en lugar de USB C a lightning.",

"  Como dice el producto, es re acondicionado, asÃ­ que no te llegarÃ¡ un producto â€œnuevoâ€. Pero la verdad es que solo le hace falta la caja original de Apple y no habrÃ­a diferencia. La pila se encontraba al 98%, NO tenÃ­a ni un solo rayÃ³n en el telÃ©fono, ademÃ¡s incluÃ­a una mica protectora y el dock, algo que ni los iPhones nuevos de Apple traen",

Acorde a su estÃ©tica estÃ¡ al 99% solo tiene unos rayoncitos muy pequeÃ±os que se perciben a contraluz. Y un poco raspadito en los botones. Pero de ahÃ­ en fuera jala sÃºper bien!HabrÃ¡ que esperar los 90 dÃ­as, pero yo creo que todo marcharÃ¡ sÃºper bien.Amo Amazon!",

Casi completamente nuevo,
"Reviewed in Mexico on November 16, 2021Size: 256GBColor: YellowService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  Tenia mis dudas sobre comprar un producto reacondicionado, pero tome el riesgo y quede bastante satisfecho! me llego con la pila al 95% y ningun rayon en la pantalla. Si acaso tenia unos pequeÃ±os raspones en la parte inferior donde se carga pero no se veian a simple vista. El cargador tiene el Certificado y funciona bastante bien, aunque opte por comprar su cargador original. En Conclusion, se los recomiendo bastante por el precio que pagas, y con amazon tienes la garantia de 90 dias ante cualquier falla o no estar satisfecho! llevo 2 semanas de uso aproximadamente y hasta ahora todo correcto, lo volveria comprar sin problemas o por lo menos tomare en cuenta esta opcion cuando quiera cambiar de celular! Vale la pena animarse por la garantia que dan,",

Bought for Christmas Gift,
"Reviewed in Canada on November 5, 2021Size: 64GBColor: PurpleService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
  Bought this for a Christmas Gift.  Works and looks great. I ordered a second one and they were three small pinhead scratches on the edges. There was a long scratch along the back but not bad. The Sim card tray was a little hard to get out. The phone itself works very good and for the price I canâ€™t complain. I would have posted pictures but Amazon of course wants access to all your photos which they donâ€™t need. What I purchase another phone if I had to? Yes,

Excelente producto a excelente precio,

"  Al principio, era algo escÃ©ptico de comprar productos â€œreacondicionadosâ€ pero me di cuenta que es lo mejor que se puede hacer.1. ahorrar dinero2. Salvar a nuestro planetaYo creo que esas son las dos mejores razones. El celular llego con 100% de baterÃ­a (habra que ver si sigue asÃ­) y estÃ©tica perfecta, le pondria un 9.5/10 por que trae ligeros rayones, pero muy poco susceptible a la vista. Lo Ãºnico que podrÃ­a â€œcriticarâ€ es que el botÃ³n de apagado no hace â€œclicâ€, pero serÃ¡ cuestion de llevarlo a limpiar con algun tÃ©cnico o algun reparador.100% convencido de mi compra, con BuySPRY.",

"  ComprÃ© este modelo porque estaba en descuento con la duda de saber que me esperarÃ­a, me desilusiono un poco porque una de las cÃ¡maras tenÃ­a un golpe y se veia pequeÃ±os raspones en un borde del telÃ©fono. Personalmente siempre utilizo mis celulares con fundas protectoras asi que por esa parte no tenia tanto problema. Fuera de eso el telÃ©fono cumpliÃ³ mis expectativas en todo. El porcentaje de bateria es de 98% sirven adecuadamente las camaras y el face ID. Si buscas un buen telÃ©fono a precios accesibles este modelo lo cumple.",

"  Mi equipo vino con bastante uso y con un desgaste avanzado de la baterÃ­a, 90 %. Equivalente a aproximadamente 1 aÃ±o de uso.Vino con varios raspones pero fuera de eso, es un equipo funcional. Lo que no ayuda es su relaciÃ³n calidad - precio, que en mi caso, no fue tan buena como para otros compradores.Tuve que solicitar un reembolso.",

"  Compre el iPhone 11 rojo 64 GB a $11,100. El producto llegÃ³ en muy buenas condiciones con una baterÃ­a Ãºtil de 92% en caja con cable y adaptador de corriente de carga rÃ¡pida todo genÃ©rico pero Ãºtil.El producto estaba excelente estÃ©ticamente sin daÃ±os visibles, un poco sucia la cÃ¡mara pero la limpiÃ© y funciona todo correcto.La considero una buena compra, sin embargo doy 4 estrellas por que en Amazon USA se puede comprar el mismo modelo por menos precio y con la opciÃ³n de Renewed Premium, con el costo de envÃ­o y los costos de aduana serÃ­a mÃ¡s barato cerca de $500-$300 pesos mexicanos mÃ¡s barato al precio que lo adquirÃ­. Recomiendo comprarlo ahÃ­, sin embargo si no tienen tiempo o baja el precio estÃ¡ es una muy buena opciÃ³n.",

Good condition camera shutter noise won't turn off.,
"Reviewed in Canada on August 7, 2021Size: 64GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase",
,
"  I bought this phone and there were no issues until I noticed the camera shutter noise not shutting off even when the silent mode is on and volume is at mute. I believe this is the case because it is manufactured in Japan and it is mandatory to have this shutter noise constantly on, but living in Canada where it isn't mandatory it is very irritating to me. I was disappointed that this was not specified in the description as this issue happens with not only the camera app but also third party apps like snapchat.",

"  Initially, I was very hesitant to purchase a phone online, a renewed one for that matter. But this phone is practically just as good as new. Mine came with a 91 percent maximum capacity which was great and a huge relief! The packaging was quite okay and the delivery was fast as well. I just got it today so we'll still see how it goes but soo far soo good. Would definitely recommend! Definitely worth it!",

"  Sencillamente me llevÃ© una grata sorpresa al recibir el telÃ©fono prÃ¡cticamente nuevo; traÃ­a un simple roce en una orilla, pero apenas se nota; la baterÃ­a es una joya, me llegÃ³ con 96 % de vida. Y en todas sus funciones ninguna falla. Llega en una caja genÃ©rica al igual que su cargador es genÃ©rico, pero venga, eso no es lo importante. Sin duda volverÃ© a comprar Â«rea condicionadoÂ».",

  El producto estÃ¡ en buenas condiciones sÃ³lo que trai de pila el 91 por ciento. Pero todo lo demÃ¡s funciona al 100 y compre cargador aparte xq el que trae hace que se caliente el telÃ©fono. Con el original hace que funcione sin problemas.,
