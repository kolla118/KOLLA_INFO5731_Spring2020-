The ear speaker on this phone does not work. I can turn the phone on speaker phone and make a phone call but when you try and take it off speakerphone all you hear is garbled voices and a lot of static. You can understand about every 10th word.  Then today when trying to make a phone call with the speakerphone every time I pushed one of the numbers to dial in the number from the pack and made a really loud high-pitched tone. When  I hit the side button to try and shut the sound off the screen went black and it still was making this weird high-pitched sound that ended up stopping after about 30-45 seconds very annoying. I finally had to shut the phone completely off and turn it back on at which point I was able to make a call on speakerphone. I’ve never had problems like this with a refurbished phone! After doing a chat with Amazon they told me I had to handle it with the seller who is supposed to be calling me to provide me with a prepaid label to return it and to discuss a replacement phone. The return policy says I have to return the phone to them and then they have two weeks to give me a refund on my money so that it will be another two weeks before a order a different phone.I just want to say that after I finally received a call from them my refund was processed very promptly.', '', '', '41 people found this helpful', '', '          Helpful', '', '', 'Report abuse', '', 'Showing 0 comments', 'There was a problem loading comments right now.

Refurbished. Quality Controlled. 70-point inspection.All indicators that you better insure any and every product purchased under the brand BuySpry because as the name suggests it will break quickly. Hopefully you are one of the lucky ones that buy second hand and receives a product that functions and lasts. You have no assurance or guarantee, just a wish. Be very careful within initial return period (most often 30 days) as any even small issue needs to be addressed. That issue, whatever it may be will prove fatal in due time. It is almost as if devices are programmed to break after 30 days. In my personal case, the iPhone I purchased after a week of normal use suffered critical issue. Customer service did not respond to the most recent message from me via email. After speaking to them on phone they stated resolution would be a refund. Do you have a back up device? I hope so. In the lucky case of an exchange (which I pushed for) brace yourself for longer than promised times to receive new product. There is a chance this turns into groundhog day but I hope you receive a working product that endures.Overall enterprise and business solution, would be to place more in reserves for replacement and increase service ability to send new product with promissory of receiving broken product. Filling this void, keeping customers whole while resolving issue. Leaving customers a loaner device would increase their reputation, making them the tallest in a room of short people but hey, you would purchase with confidence under that premise right?

I figured that I could easily try the current iPhone and sell it again if I didn't like it. I am pleasantly surprised by pretty much everything this phone offers.I'm going to start with the battery life, because that is the because surprise I have had coming to this phone. On day one with my old phone, I would get at max 6 hours of SoT (screen on time) before the phone would die. That was typically enough for me to go from 6am to 10pm with enough left over for me to not feel worried about dying in the middle of the day. Prior to buying this phone that battery life dropped to roughly 3.5-4 hours of SoT before dying.This new (refurbished I know) phone easily gets ~8 hours of SoT, easily going even higher depending on what I'm doing. I can go a full two days without a charge. That's with bluetooth on 24/7. To say I am happy with the battery is an understatement.The other features, are also pretty good. Not anything that blows me out of the water, but definitely at least as good as the other competition. The face unlock, which I assumed was going to be terrible, is much better than I expected. I would still prefer a fast fingerprint sensor, but this thing does the job almost as well. I have had a few instances where it refuses to recognize me on the first attempt, but they are uncommon. The camera is as good as you would expect from a modern smartphone, with several extra features that are actually useful in certain circumstances.Long story short: I will definitely be sticking with this phone for the foreseeable future.\", '', '', '9 people found this helpful', '', '          Helpful', '', '', 'Report abuse', '', 'Showing 0 comments', 'There was a problem loading comments right now.

I had previously purchased a renewed Galaxy phone from Amazon and the phone was practically new for a small fraction of the price and it came with the original box and accessories. I thought it'd be worth it to save $100 or more since my last experience went so well. Unfortunately, the iPhone I received was very visibly used with scratches littering both sides of the phone, but without deep cracks to the screen. The battery's health was on the lower side. The phone also came in a generic box with generic accessories, which was to be expected since it is in the item description, but when you look at what you get for the renewed price it seems like a poor deal. Thankfully Amazon has a longer return period if the phone doesn't work out for you, but I only needed a few minutes with the phone to know that I'd rather buy a new phone from Apple for $100 more.\", '', '', '4 people found this helpful', '', '          Helpful', '', '', 'Report abuse', '', 'Showing 0 comments', 'There was a problem loading comments right now.

Second after finally getting the phone to activate after letting it die out for a day because you have to turn a phone off & on for proper activation it finally started to work. I had gotten a screen protector & phone case for this iPhone 11 all for it not to work. After four days of having the phone i could no longer have a conversation on the phone. I could answer the phone & people could hear me but I couldn’t hear them, Then shortly after being on the phone it would hang up & say call failed. When I was on FaceTime the front camera was glitching on the video. I’ve had enough of this phone. Called straight talk this morning to have my minutes transferred to my other phone, will be taking my screen protector & case off && taking my new sims card out to return this phone TODAY for a full refund. This is my second time purchasing a phone from Amazon & BOTH times the phones were defects or glitches how you wanna say. I will NOT be ordering anymore phones online again. First time shame on you, second time shame on me & there will NOT BE A THIRD. People please read these reviews carefully because the person selling you the phone do NOT care.

The phone already came cracked on the side where the lock button is, I guess that’s why the phone won’t power off for me to complete the activation. Second after finally getting the phone to activate after letting it die out for a day because you have to turn a phone off & on for proper activation it finally started to work. I had gotten a screen protector & phone case for this iPhone 11 all for it not to work. After four days of having the phone i could no longer have a conversation on the phone. I could answer the phone & people could hear me but I couldn’t hear them, Then shortly after being on the phone it would hang up & say call failed. When I was on FaceTime the front camera was glitching on the video. I’ve had enough of this phone. Called straight talk this morning to have my minutes transferred to my other phone, will be taking my screen protector & case off && taking my new sims card out to return this phone TODAY for a full refund. This is my second time purchasing a phone from Amazon & BOTH times the phones were defects or glitches how you wanna say. I will NOT be ordering anymore phones online again. First time shame on you, second time shame on me & there will NOT BE A THIRD. People please read these reviews carefully because the person selling you the phone do NOT care.

The battery life was at 100 percent. I had no complaints. One thing I noticed was that the app snapchat is glitchy on the phone. If you try to edit something for your story it just discards it after 30 seconds. Other than that,  it didn't come with earphones. As most people know the Iphone 11 has no headphone jack. So it's crucial that when we buy these phones we should get everything like new. Also, the charger is probably only a foot long. I like to play games or change my music while i'm laying down. I can't do that because the charger is so short. Last but not least, when you get the phone, the instructions are horrible. It tells you to download an app and what not, that just glitches your phone. Don't do it. Instead look up a video online on how to insert a sim card into an Iphone. From there, when you turn on the phone it will have instructions set up from apple. Do not! I repeat do not! Use the instructions provided. If you are switching from android to apple, it will take you longer to set up your phone because you need an apple ID. Also, you need to save your contacts, and write them down. Even after saving all my contacts to my sim card, when I inserted it, none were there.

Ludacris, absurd solution! I finally had to get Amazon customer service involved, 6 phone calls over the span of a week and they were nice about it but I had to drive the phone 45 minutes to a UPS drop off spot after that and finally got a refund but not for the full price paid so I had to call Amazon AGIAN to get it fully rectified. Even the Amazon representative said this was a totally bogus response and proposed solution from the seller and to not buy 3rd party seller items in future. Lesson learned!

There is a small nick in the paint right above the power button, case hides it though.The battery is at 100%!! I did have some questions about the ear speaker. The calls were sounding crackly. I called Amazon and got disconnected but they emailed me and said to try and brush the ear speaker out. I did it and it seems to have helped but I don’t know if it’s 100%.The phone is great, It came with a screen protector on it and I don’t like those at all but it is on there very well so I’ll leave it for now.My girlfriend is getting my IPhone 8+ which has a bigger screen than hers and retains the home button.Overall happy with it, it does take some time getting use to it without a home button but Face ID works well.', '', '', 'One person found this helpful', '', '          Helpful', '', '', 'Report abuse', '', 'Showing 0 comments', 'There was a problem loading comments right now.

However, the screen has two small gouge-like scratches, which is annoying because I can tell this screen is a third-party, cheaper replacement, as it’s backlight is more yellow than the XR screen.

Battery health is at 84%, but still lasted longer today than the XR battery with a health of 88% (and under heavier use as I played YT music most of the day).

The phone was barely used, inside an office but it was a needed line. A screen protector and cover were installed as the phone was being setup.Over a month of use, the screen started playing games. It would show random patterns or freeze but given that there were updates in between those days, I thought it had to do with updates. However, the issues would continue to happen more and more often and lasting longer so I decided to return, since it was obvious the screen was faulty.CPRTX decided the only thing they needed to return was 72 cents out of the $564 of the phone. Despite being covered by the A to Z Amazon Guarantee, I'm still fighting for my refund - and hope I don't get $565 stolen from them. They keep saying I damaged the phone but their own pictures show a pristine, perfect screen, except when turned on.Otherwise, the iPhone 11 was impeccable. You could tell they did some work by looking at the screws at the bottom but other than that, beautiful. The screen did not seem original but it was working great and so was everything else. You could not believe someone had used that phone before which confirms that there are people out there, like myself, who take really good care of their devices.iOS 14.6 works great in the iPhone 11 and the camera does a better job than the iPhone 6 Plus it replaced. You will also enjoy the added screen size (if you're coming from any of the iPhone Pluses) despite having a smaller device. I do miss TouchID and you will too. Overall, iPhone 11, a great phone. CPRTX - Thieves!So a big warning. Do not trust this (CPRTX) seller. They will do everything in their power to steal from you and do not care if the ship to you a faulty phone.

I go through boost and it’s hard to get phones under boost so I normally look for unlocked phones. It says it’s unlocked in packaging and on here… I began the activation process … and it wouldn’t not let me I looked further and went to setting and under SIM card it said it was locked!!!! It’s disappointing because I have to go through so much to get it unlocked and now I can’t even use the phone until then !!! The product was promoted as unlocked as well as the paper work that came with the phone! It’s just frustrating because I rely on my phone a lot. And to not have one is such an inconvenience especially after I paid for it to be unlocked which might not only cost me out of pocket but my time. I might as well have bought a phone from my carrier.

It still costs a pretty penny but you’re unable to view the quality before hand.

Everything Else so far has been perfect but don’t expect to get a flawless phone. a simple screen cover helped the scratch look but that’s not the point.

Stuck with 64GB, but I don't use too many apps nor plan to keep photos/videos stored on it.As someone who has been on Android since the start of smartphones, this is THE time where jumping to iOS is going to be the most smooth, and you'll enjoy a few extra features. This won't happen until iOS 14, but once it's released, it will make this phone a great choice even for users used to Android.The phone, like many other phones, is a little too smooth for holding, which makes pressing buttons by accident a thing, so slap on a case not only to protect it, but to make handling better. One upcoming feature in iOS 14 is the ability to tap the back of the phone for your chosen options, so it's yet to be known if protective cases will get in the way of that functionality. I don't use headphones much, but it is still annoying knowing these phones no longer have an analogue 3.5mm audio jack. The packaging is top notch tho, and I've been using the screen protector it shipped with, even though I don't think it's meant to stay on the phone lol, but if it gets bubbles or just gets too damaged, I'll just replace it. It still ships with a ton of apps you may or may not use. I don't use a few of them and a couple cannot be deleted. iOS 14 will allow us to hide them tho, so this will soon be a thing of the past. Getting used to navigating the system doesn't take too long, even to an Android user. Eventually things just flow.I picked this phone because it's as good as the 11 pro/pro max, but without the telephoto lens, and still bigger than the 11 pro. I felt it was a reasonable compromise since I will rarely need the optical zoom capabilities of the pro max. The wide lens is something I will use far more since it comes in handy when you want to take pictures of a room and sometimes you simply have no space to move far back enough. That's the rear cameras, but the front camera can also do .5 wide, which is good for vloggers/irl streamers, especially if you ever need to include another person in the shot.Setup is ez pz and now you can import your stuff not only if you are upgrading from another iPhone, but you can also import stuff from Android, you only need to download an app to the Android phone for it to work.I haven't used all the features of the phone yet, but it looks like it's going to be a good experience, at least until Apple decides to slow it down to coerce me to upgrade lol.\", '', '', '3 people found this helpful', '', '          Helpful', '', '', 'Report abuse', '', 'Showing 0 comments', 'There was a problem loading comments right now.

It was a phone my sister no longer needed to I upgraded from the iphone 4. I haven't felt the need to upgrade since newer iphones basically do the same thing except for the facial thing blah blah. I don't need all that and I actually prefer a phone that has the wired jack plug. Why in the world did Apple ever do away with that?!Anyways, I realized I needed a new phone with the Iphone 6s plus started taking really crappy photos and was just slower overall even after I changed out the battery. So I started looking for newer phones and a friend recommended Amazon and that a renewed phone wasn't a bad way to go. The Iphone 11 purple 128 gb was a great deal considering brand new phones go for well over 1100-1300. I had some issues setting up the new iphone (my fault with forgetting my encryption passcode) but I was finally able to get the new iphone updated, transferred over my data, inserted the Sim card, and it works great with Mint Mobile. No issues so far with Mint that I have seen yet. The back and front did have a few slight smudges however it was nothing a tempered glass screen couldn't cover up and honestly I don't notice them at all when I am using the phone. It is in great condition but the battery is at 85% so I'm thinking in the next 6 months to 1 year I will need to replace the battery.Overall, this has been a great experience. I love the new phone and will update my review in 90 days.\", '', '', '', '', '          Helpful', '', '', 'Report abuse', '', 'Showing 0 comments', 'There was a problem loading comments right now.

It has a few problems but it is a solid iPhone.Camera: This phone takes really good pictures. It has live photos you can blur out your backgrounds and even up the camera to 4k. It has a nighttime mode where you can change your picture to look like it was taken during the day. It is a cool thing but the zoom in the future is not that good, it comes out blurry.Battery; The battery life on the phone was amazing after about 1 week of having it die faster. When you are using specific apps it dies quickly. You can go from 100 to 70 in just 10 mins. Also, it tends to burn up when you are using apps.Price: The iPhone 11 stands at about $409 and $521 Canadian. Before the price was a lot higher but with a price like this it is a must-get for anyone looking for a decent Phone.I compared the iPhone 11 to the iPhone 10. The build is the same, it looks the same other than the camera. The iPhone X takes a point for battery life. The iPhone 11 dies faster than the iPhone X. the iPhone 11 has a much better camera than the X because it has 1.71x more megapixels which make the camera a lot better. And if you are a person that likes to play games the iPhone 11 has a higher resolution, a fast download time and the CPU is great. So the iPhone 11 is Better than the iPhone X.The iPhone 11 is the same as the XR. It has one less camera than Apple's more-premium models, and its screen isn't nearly as nice. There are advantages to the Pros, but after getting a for what the iPhone 11 is capable of, spending the extra $300 is not a bad thing, it is really good and worth it.\", '', '', '', '', '          Helpful', '', '', 'Report abuse', '', 'Showing 0 comments', 'There was a problem loading comments right now.

I had a galaxy S9 but I accidentally cracked the screen, so I decided to get the S10 on a whim. I immediately hated it. I’ve been just tolerating it for 9 months, and was prepared to just tolerate it for the full 2 years. But then I found this deal on a refurb iPhone 11!Like everyone else I was a little skeptical over it being a refurb but it came in excellent condition! The only cosmetic damage is a very small scratch on the screen which is invisible unless you’re really inspecting the screen.The battery life on this phone so far has been pretty amazing. I use my phone a lot at home and especially for work, the battery lasted almost 2 full days???? Not sure if that’s because it’s so new but either way I’m happy.Having never owned an iPhone before I was nervous that I would absolutely hate the ui but I got used to it pretty quickly! I actually really really like this phone! The display is a much better resolution than the S10 even though the screen size is exactly the same. The audio seems to be much clearer as well.I also really love the unique color! The pictures of it really don’t do it justice. In the listing it looks like a light grayish lavender but in person it’s more saturated. I’ve only had it for 4 days and it’s already gotten lots of compliments!Overall I really really like this phone so far and I really have no complaints.

All in all, this was a good purchase, although it was quite pricey.', '        ', '', '', '                Images in this review', '            ', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '   function toggleSeeAllView() {', \"       P.when('A', 'cr-image-popover-controller').execute(function(A, imagePopoverController) {\", '          imagePopoverController.toggleSeeAllView(true);', '       });', '   }', '', '', '', '', \"        P.when('A', 'cr-image-popover-controller').execute(function(A, imagePopoverController) {\", '          A.on(\"a:popover:beforeShow:R2DAPM3LAT6I2B_gallerySection_main\", function(data) {', '            imagePopoverController.initImagePopover(\"R2DAPM3LAT6I2B\", \"[https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71f7Hvzm0vL._SL1600_.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iAqy0gbbL._SL1600_.jpg]\", data);', '          });', '        });', '    ', '', '', '', '          Helpful', '', '', 'Report abuse', '', 'Showing 0 comments', 'There was a problem loading comments right now.

This product is The iphone 11, created by Apple. Apple also makes other electronics such as tablets, bluetooth earphones, smart watches, computers, streaming devices and even accessories to go with these devices. I have had this product for about two years now, and it's still working perfectly fine. This product looks like the iPhone XR but with two caramers.  It’s all red, with the word “(Product) RED” on it. It is 128GB with a 6.1 inch screen size. This is one of the best iPhones Apple has created.You might ask how this product works, and how could you use it? The product is a phone so you can call out on it. You can FaceTime other iPhone users, you can also browse through the web, you can take pictures one, and you can text people. This product is very easy to use and if you don’t know how to use it they come with a “HOW TO” so you can get a good understanding of your phone. I have used this product to the max. I have done everything with this phone. For example, I have played games on it, called people, and texted them. I have also sent emails, plus I have done my school work with it.What are some pros and cons of this iPhone? Well some pros would have to be how good the phone looks. This iPhone was  one of the first phones to have two camera. This phone has one of the faster smartphone chips in it. Which means the phone moves faster and loads up thighs a lot faster. Some more pros are that it has very good video, and screen quality. The iPhone also comes in more new colors then any other phone.The cons are lower than you think. One of them is that it didn’t come with the new fast charger unlike the 11 pro max and up. This phone didn’t come with an ultra wide lens, which means that any phone that’s newer than this phone has a better camera. Some more are that it didn’t have any updates to the screen, so it’s still the same as the iPhone XR. And, lastly the phone only comes with 64 to 256GB, so there's less storage on the phone.In conclusion you see that this is a great phone to purchase. The two years of experience I have is letting you know what I’m talking about. The pros and cons help you understand the phone some more, and it could help you towards your final purchase.\", '', '', '', '', '          Helpful', '', '', 'Report abuse', '', 'Showing 0 comments', 'There was a problem loading comments right now.

It came in really good shape couldn't tell it was renewed other than the damaged box and the charger it came with didn't charge it more than a couple percent in the 30 minutes it was plugged in. It arrived with a completely empty battery which was a bummer but my son charged it to 56 percent, did an update, uploaded his apps, and transferred all his data and after 2 hours the battery was only down 4 percent. He was really happy with it. And he said the camera was great. Him and his brother were having so much fun playing with the features. This is the second renewed apple product I've purchased and I recommend buying Amazon renewed to a lot of my friends. The great customer service and 90 day guarantee are really comforting.

The screen has a noticeable scratch, which was to be expected. The delivery was quick and came next day. Mine came with freebies such as a screen protector and phone case.
